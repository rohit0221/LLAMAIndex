Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\n                                                 primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\n                                                 outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\n                                                 investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\n                                                 and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\n                                                 portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\n                                                 efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\n                                                 development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\n                                                vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\n                                                This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\n                                                 academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\n                                                 and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\n                                                 library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\n                                                 tions.

DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\n    However, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24 ], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel.\\n    LayoutParser provides a unified toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n 1. An off-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\n     recognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n 2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\n     underlies the off-the-shelf usage\\n 3. Comprehensive tools for efficient document image data annotation and model\\n     tuning to support different levels of customization\\n 4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\n     tion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\n     reproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacrificing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will benefit a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\n    LayoutParser is well aligned with recent efforts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34 ] and com-\\nputer vision [35 ], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

The dhSegment [ 22 ] utilizes fully convolutional networks [ 20 ] for segmen-\\n tation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\n R-CNN [ 28] and Mask R-CNN [12 ] are used for identifying document elements [ 38]\\n and detecting tables [ 30, 26 ]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29 ] have also\\n been used in table detection [ 27 ]. However, these models are usually implemented\\n individually and there is no unified framework to load and use such models.\\n     There has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\n image processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\n relevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\n or provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\n OCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\n similar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21 ], it is designed for\\n analyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\n The DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\n documents via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\n and Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\n layout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\n Analysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15 ] and the DeepDIVA project [2 ]\\n aim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\n are not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [ 14], easyOCR11 and\\n paddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\\n DIA tasks like layout analysis.\\n     Recent years have also seen numerous efforts to create libraries for promoting\\n reproducibility and reusability in the field of DL.

For “base model” and “large model”, we refer to using the ResNet 50 or ResNet 101\\n   backbones [ 13], respectively. One can train models of different architectures, like Faster R-CNN [ 28] (F) and Mask\\n   R-CNN [ 12] (M). For example, an F in the Large Model column indicates it has a Faster R-CNN model trained\\n   using the ResNet 101 backbone.

We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\n  component.\\n\\n  3.1      Layout Detection Models\\n  In LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\n  generates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Different\\n  from traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\n  than manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\n  object detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28 ] and\\n  Mask R-CNN [ 12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\n  makes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\n  LayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35 ], provides a minimal API that can\\n  perform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2 . imread ( \" image_file \" ) # load images\\n3 model = lp . Detectron2LayoutModel (\\n4         \" lp :// PubLayNet / faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x / config \" )\\n5 layout = model . detect ( image )\\n       LayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\n  datasets covering different languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\\n  domain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\n  plied to target samples that are significantly different from the training dataset. As\\n  document structures and layouts vary greatly in different domains, it is important\\n  to select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\\n  is used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset\\n  name and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

All model outputs from LayoutParser will be\\nstored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which\\nmakes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within\\nLayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely\\nthe Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide different\\nlevels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for\\ntransformations or operations on these classes.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Currently,\\n  three types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser, shown\\n  in Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\\n  support specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\\n  with 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\\n  a more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\\n  is skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be specified and a total\\n  of 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\\n  like shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in,\\n  are supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\\n  of the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\\n  for this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\\n  transformations like relative_to and condition_on that transform coordinates\\n  to and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\\n  detailed description of these operations13.\\n       Based on Coordinates, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\\n  the positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports\\n  specifying the reading orders via setting the parent field to the index of the parent\\n  object. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlocks and supports\\n  processing the elements in batch. Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical\\n  layout structures. They support the same operations and transformations as the\\n  Coordinate classes, minimizing both learning and deployment effort.\\n\\n  3.3     OCR\\n  LayoutParser provides a unified interface for existing OCR tools. Though there\\n  are many OCR tools available, they are usually configured differently with distinct\\n  APIs or protocols for using them. It can be inefficient to add new OCR tools into\\n  an existing pipeline, and difficult to make direct comparisons among the available\\n  tools to find the best option for a particular project. To this end, LayoutParser\\n  builds a series of wrappers among existing OCR engines, and provides nearly\\n  the same syntax for using them. It supports a plug-and-play style of using OCR\\n  engines, making it effortless to switch, evaluate, and compare different OCR\\n  modules:\\n1 ocr_agent = lp . TesseractAgent ()\\n2 # Can be easily switched to other OCR software\\n3 tokens = ocr_agent . detect ( image )\\n       The OCR outputs will also be stored in the aforementioned layout data\\n  structures and can be seamlessly incorporated into the digitization pipeline.\\n  Currently LayoutParser supports the Tesseract and Google Cloud Vision OCR\\n  engines.\\n       LayoutParser also comes with a DL-based CNN-RNN OCR model [ 6] trained\\n  with the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss [10 ]. It can be used\\n  like the other OCR modules, and can be easily trained on customized datasets.\\n  13 This is also available in the LayoutParser documentation pages.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\n     Beyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\nument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n\\n5     Use Cases\\nThe core objective of LayoutParser is to make it easier to create both large-scale\\nand light-weight document digitization pipelines.

Shen et al.\\n\\n     To decipher the complicated layout\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32 ] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\nposition. Errors are identified and rectified via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [ 19 ]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\n     A combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The flexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\n     Additionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith different glyphs, which significantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special flat font is used for printing\\nnumbers and could not be detected by off-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\nflexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal effort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identifies characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances17 for token prediction on the test set.\\n     Overall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate fine-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\n                                                                                      the maximum is 1.\\n   and lower is better.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Many previous works [ 26 , 30 , 27]\\nand tools 18 have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\\nmight require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\\nfor born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how LayoutParser can\\nhelp build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\nusing the existing resources with minimal effort.\\n     The extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\ntable regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\nPDF image. Mask R-CNN [12 ] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [38 ] from the\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By filtering\\nout model predictions of low confidence and removing overlapping predictions,\\nLayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which significantly\\nsimplifies the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\nmethod is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\ngaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at different positions\\non a page accurately. Continued tables from different pages are concatenated,\\nand a structured table representation has been easily created.\\n\\n18 https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot, https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Shen et al.\\n\\n6     Conclusion\\n\\nLayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document\\nimage analysis. The off-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to\\nbuild flexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated\\nstructures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and\\ntraining of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser\\ncommunity platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting\\ndiscussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. The LayoutParser\\nteam is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing\\nthe most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document\\nmodeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.\\n\\nAcknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments\\nand suggestions.

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\n                                                 primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\n                                                 outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\n                                                 investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\n                                                 and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\n                                                 portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\n                                                 efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\n                                                 development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\n                                                vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\n                                                This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\n                                                 academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\n                                                 and humanities.

The layout detection models enable the use of pre-trained or self-trained DL models for layout detection with just four lines of code. The layout data structure includes the Coordinate system, TextBlock, and Layout, which provide different levels of abstraction for the layout data and support various APIs for transformations and operations. The OCR module facilitates optical character recognition. The community platform includes the DIA Model Hub, DIA Pipeline Sharing, and Storage & Visualization features. The core LayoutParser library offers off-the-shelf tools for layout detection, OCR, visualization, and storage, supported by a carefully designed layout data structure.\n"
