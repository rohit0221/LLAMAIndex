\u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding interim financial reporting. The\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.\nCertain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted\npursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nresults for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the\nfinancial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed\nwith the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and\nvoting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where\napplicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2\ninstrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using\nmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted\nmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of\ncommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held\ncompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\ninvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31,\n2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Note Receivables MLU B.V.

The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special\ninterest.\nUpon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and\nshares of our common stock, at our election.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $185 million and $(232) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was primarily driven by current tax on foreign earnings, the deferred U.S. tax impact\nrelated to our investment in Aurora upon the sale of our ATG Business, offset by a partial benefit from U.S. losses. During the three months ended March 31, 2022,\nthe income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, the\nbenefit of U.S. losses, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due\nto the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Grab, Aurora, Didi and Zomato, the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets,\nand foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, and this amount would not\nimpact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign\ntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in\nwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For\nour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the\nfull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2022.\nBased on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nNote 10 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible\nsecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using\nthe equity method.\n24", "mimetype":

determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating\ndecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nAs of the first quarter of 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegmentDescription\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Financial Partnerships and Transit offerings.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\nwell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\nshipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, refer to Note 2 \u2013 Revenue. Our segment operating performance measure is segment\nadjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and\nadministrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that\nmanagement does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table below). The following table provides information about our\nsegments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2021 2022\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\nMobility $ 298 $ 618 \nDelivery (200) 30 \nFreight (29) 2 \nAll Other (11) \u2014 \nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA 58 650 \nReconciling items:\nCorporate G&A and Platform R&D (417) (482)\nDepreciation and amortization (212) (254)\nStock-based compensation expense (281) (359)\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements (551) \u2014 \nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets (57) (13)\nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses (36) (14)\nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets (2) \u2014 \nCOVID-19 response initiatives (26) (1)\nLoss on lease arrangements, net \u2014 (7)\nRestructuring and related charges \u2014 (2)\nLoss from operations $ (1,524)$ (482)\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense.\nIncludes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s\ncontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of\nbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a\npetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a ruling\nwas made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations B.V. are\nstill pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent\nworkers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has no impact\non our current operations. A ruling on the merits by the Federal Tribunal is expected in 2023.

The\ntribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of\nthe App in July 2016.

We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at\nthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law\npurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage\nwhen driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a\nsettlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a\nsettlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement\nwho are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place in 2022 for\nclaimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.

However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently\nunpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and\nsettlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nState Unemployment Taxes\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (\u201cNJDOL\u201d) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes\nof determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both\nRasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from\n2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised\namount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments.

Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\nOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of\ntheir respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to\ncompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March\n26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against\nAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its\nrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and\nGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google\non behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.\nWhether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.\nIn March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the\ntrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to\nperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement, which was\nformally approved by the court on May 2, 2022. The approval of the settlement and confirmation of Levandowski\u2019s bankruptcy plan is subject to appeal by May\n16, 2022, by certain creditors and the taxing authorities.

Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (20%) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that we\ncharge Drivers prior to March 14, 2022. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and\nHMRC is also expected to consider the UK Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be\nclassified as a provider of transportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC.

As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of\nthe ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated\nLiquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the\nform of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested\n$400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of\nAurora.\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model.\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving\nvehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue\nto vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we initially recognized liabilities of $315 million as consideration\nfor these future obligations to Aurora.\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does\nnot qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this transaction.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, results of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements\nand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight\nindustry. We are also developing technologies that provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Employment\nTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather\nthan independent contractors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5146, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0aef8b6-a94b-4311-8322-f319c460dc69": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0aef8b6-a94b-4311-8322-f319c460dc69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6d729a98-390b-4511-9282-3d8f00ad0442", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "359dd5160cbbaf1a556751284d288060452974a0883a66069e79e9f82d853a98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c90397a5-49d9-4c4f-961c-a5e253d737e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "59d1510cbe6e7b66eaeb0863ab41ed72529eb41416d4f79c6eb63b15d541fba4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed\nto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling.

Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $359 million of stock-based compensation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $168 million, up $527 million compared to the same period in 2021. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit improved by 107%, year-over-\nyear, to $618 million. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $30 million, up $230 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $200 million in the same period in\n2021.\nWe ended the quarter with $4.2 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\nOther Developments\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has\nrapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple cities\u2019 and\nstates\u2019 declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other\nmeasures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility\nrides. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to\nbe impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\nWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve. We are focused on\nnavigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability\nto meet our short-term liquidity needs. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an\nexpedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\nTo comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended, our shared Mobility offering, in most\nmarkets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that\nconsumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and consumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed courier availability.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4285, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1da686d-124e-45cf-9f38-456bc0ca57b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1da686d-124e-45cf-9f38-456bc0ca57b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fef01ac9-c46b-4eb5-ac3a-69be93d8e790", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "2f049a206b15df3ba2435f3afc510143a7a3c1ac528d032bb8c7b2da8c01c3f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02bb2d96-eec2-492e-9adf-4d930c5044b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "ab81e29cb7168f750473669d0aacf81143558a5b917e3c2af38e656f83666e92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "COVID-19 Response Initiatives\nWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve.

We have concluded that we are an agent in these\narrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue\nRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021 and Note 2 \u2013 Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit\ncard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight transportation\nservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are\nprimarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip\nvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located\ndata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer\nsupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of\ncertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the\nforeseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and\nproduct development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We\nexpense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and\ndevelopment activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by a\ndecrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business.\n35", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5125, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09ca5ad4-ba3a-425c-b26d-582f15b57274": {"__data__": {"id_": "09ca5ad4-ba3a-425c-b26d-582f15b57274", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "82b2dd40-36dc-41e1-a585-8d5a8545feba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "3cec6a1e5511ac706577ca6ff7e6d9f40fef05b22da0502cea55b587e42267e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "General and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as\nallocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs.

MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery\norder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our\nplatform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of\ntransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX\nShare ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip.

These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)\nattributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest\nexpense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory\nreserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii)\nrestructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related\npayments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver\nreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and\nothers in need as well as charitable donations.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our\noperating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that\nAdjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our\nmanagement team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of\ncertain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $289 million\nas of March 31, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively. We did\nnot have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of March 31, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds\nand cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.\nChanges in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\ninvestments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair\nvalue of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of\ntime after a public offering. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following\nrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\nbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our\nbusiness.\n\u2022Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,\nlow barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,\nand may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\nfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and\nnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to\nmaintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n\u2022Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these\nchallenges may not be successful.\n\u2022If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be\nadversely affected.\n\u2022Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may\nharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\n\u2022We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are\ninherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\n50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5168, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3acdec8-abd3-4e7f-a274-77ef86e86685": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3acdec8-abd3-4e7f-a274-77ef86e86685", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f62feb8-77c8-4bbc-8834-92c4354a3242", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "fcbbbedf47756f0e47a98867a234cb2cdff1a49505703f0188a03d69d5af6c60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by\neconomic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.\n\u2022We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such\ntechnologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by\ncompetitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\n\u2022Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or\nconfidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\n\u2022Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating\nresults.\n\u2022We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\nimpacted.\n\u2022We have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\n\u2022We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and\nofferings.

Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,\nvarious governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures, limitations\non social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example,\nby reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand.

Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and we are\nobserving that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, as such supply constraints have been and may continue to be impacted by\nconcerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, to support social\ndistancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has required\nand may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing models\nof our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do\nnot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,\nand results of operations. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the\nduration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the\nadministration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supply\nchains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our\nend-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital\nmarkets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other\nrisks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could\nadversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims.

Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial\ndecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses\nassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social\nsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional\ncosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have\nadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority\nof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have\nan adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather\nthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, going\nforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid\nholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a\ndriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French\nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),\ndecisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent\nSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are\nemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.

We cannot assure you that our pricing models or strategies will be successful in attracting\nconsumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer\nstructure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our\nbusiness may be adversely impacted.\nThe markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors\nwill continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders, including SoftBank (a large stockholder), have made substantial investments in certain\nof our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the\nfuture. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more\neffectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,\nmerchants, shippers, and carriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or\nmaintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively\nnascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2021, and as of March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $29.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease\nproportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be\nable to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we\ncontinue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and\npromotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire\nadditional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase\nrevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to\nadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower\nservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a\nnegative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to\nadditional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or\nmaintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all.

We have previously received significant media coverage and\nnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain\nor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the\nengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse\nplatform user sentiment.\nWe have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled\ndistrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it\ndifficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny,\nand results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital, increased\ntheir investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nIn 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have\noccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain\ncontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,\nand consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we\nannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,\nmerchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the\nlaw, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result\nin harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts.

Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally\nmanaged, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated or managed to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although\nwe have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, such reorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our\ncompany.\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If we\nare unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future\nprospects will be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and\nhas placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and\ninternal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect\nour operating results.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,900 global employees as of March 31,\n2022, of whom approximately 18,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the United States to\nincrease as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including\nengineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new hires\nperform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing\nemployees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve\nthe technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls\nover financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our\ntransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with\nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving\nrisks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current\nand planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire\nadditional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or\ncarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, products\nand offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally.

In addition, we do not\nindependently test Drivers\u2019 driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to receive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or\nthreatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification\nprocesses and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform.\nIf Drivers or carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform as\na conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of\nour business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents and\nallegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwise\nengaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct while\nusing our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates of\nviolent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of\nDrivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other\ncriminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed,\nand our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,\nwhether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers,\nor third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face\nlitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,\nneed to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of\nwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are\nexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our\noperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant\ncosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.

international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with\nand investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy\nhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our\ncompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of\nDidi or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi and\nZomato.

Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi\njoint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these\ncompanies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally,\nthese companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets\nthroughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and\nprospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these\nassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect\nsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies\nhave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited\npublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular\neconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are\ndomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts\nof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on\nthe relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive\npositions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint\nventure, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broader\nconsequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions\nbetween the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted.

These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.\nFor Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and\ntypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain\ncities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our\nrevenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal\nfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of\nDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult\nto detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal\ntrends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as\na result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our\noperations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with\ntechnological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation,\nand other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense\nlevels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we\ncannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not achieve profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\nmetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo\nin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives\nand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are\nsusceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious\ndiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in\nwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics\nor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,\nor regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater\ndegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect\nour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew\nexisting licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such\nmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,\nthe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural\nareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would\nbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and\nfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related\nMobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by\nmandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned\nridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the\nrequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against\nus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our\noperations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-\nimposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could\nintroduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora\nor other partners.

Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19\nmore generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and\nsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition.

Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the\nmerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases\nfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at\nmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products\nand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or\nalternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may\ncontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,\nincreased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain\ninternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these\nincreased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these\nincreased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants\nto cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary\nor confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 license\nnumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.

We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data\nsecurity incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an\nemployee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October and November of 2016,\noutside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d).

For further information\non this incident, see the risk factors titled \u201c\u2014We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state\nAttorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business\u201d and \u201c\u2014We face risks\nrelated to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and\nregulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,\u201d below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for\nbreaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had\nbeen subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem\nbecomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we\nexperience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been\nsubject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final\ncourt approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or\nother data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business\ndisruption, and significant liabilities.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we may\nfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development of\nnew products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.

For example, some product changes in\nCalifornia have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and\nadverse impacts on the operation of our platform.

For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of\nService and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other\nadverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow\nconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).\nIn 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in\nwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many\njurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply\nwith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those\njurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for\nDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety\nincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of\nthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash\nreceived for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always\neffective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot\nguarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a\nvariety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,\nwe may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation.

In addition,\neven if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to\nviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive\nincentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons,\nor the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and\noperating results.\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,\n67", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4244, "end_char_idx": 6611, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca6b99ed-37c7-43d1-848b-7982d85e889d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca6b99ed-37c7-43d1-848b-7982d85e889d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f06418ef-4913-45b8-8a2a-9b1db3cb59aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "750629a67820abcd92763a658fc51eb9f3d1ce7857e3982a019e6068b4f5802b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ec2cb75-ca32-4e4d-8f9e-617196321045", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7e24f7446eaa248c9f0b6c053f28284b46e27650dbfbe245d60728fed813e98e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "business, and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations.

Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated\ncyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of\nour systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive\nposition, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely\naffect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,\nissues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or\nbreaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain\naccess to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective\nmanner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the\ntypes and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to\ndevelop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and\nsecurity breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result of, for example,\nsoftware bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we\nmay incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks.

If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the\nprovision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and\nofferings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their services through our platform, and reduce use of our platform by\nconsumers and shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe\nour platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational capacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our\nability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.\nWe use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source\nsoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing\nterms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\nmake available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor\nour compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source\nlicense review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of\nsuch license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source\nsoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such\nlicenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions\nof our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-\nsource licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present\nadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our\nplatform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects\nbecomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be\nunable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial\ncondition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.\nFinancing and Transactional Risks\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nTo continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings,\nand markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,\nand any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders.

Furthermore, our future\nincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.

Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain\njurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial\nstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\n72", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4289, "end_char_idx": 6343, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75076b57-62cf-4019-a912-51dafe3e972a": {"__data__": {"id_": "75076b57-62cf-4019-a912-51dafe3e972a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c61bbaf2-70d8-4c0b-8787-14cb1e3bdd4e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "747757091c4d074ae9dffef9be454a304f913c170b0a772a5b92f5970fe84c78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aee2b9e5-9a0a-48a1-a848-9d4acddaa79e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "518c4c67362d89987f292eca5b5dba668be405302b4a99ed074cc24fbf310620", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017,\nand modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and\nregulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well\nas interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or\nincrease certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and\nlocal taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Furthermore, beginning on January 1, 2022,\nthe Act eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these\nexpenses. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision\nwill be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or modified, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely\nimpacted by this legislation.\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that\nwe have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where\nwe have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential\nchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could\nbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental\nbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and\nhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding\nscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and\n$12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January\n1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,\nwe also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating loss\ncarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if\nwe are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive\napproval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.\nWe may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of\navailable cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate\nand execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and\noperating results may be harmed.\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and\ntechnologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and\nexpansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies\nregarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and\ndoing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing\nsignificant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis.

For example,\nwith respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company\u2019s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber\u2019s apps and\neach company\u2019s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company\u2019s own Chief Executive\nOfficer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or\nreputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar laws outside the United\nStates.

For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In\nAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising\ncap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.\nAlthough such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in\nNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect\non January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In\naddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January\n1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to\nnegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform.

Furthermore, such business\npractices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue.\nIn addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may continue to\nfavor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle certifications. In addition, an\nincreasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our\nMobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business\nmodel in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and\nother requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs of March 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject to differing, and sometimes\nconflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional,\nand local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nCertain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we\noperate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing\nservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb\nair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the\ninstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect\nin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition\nto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to\nhave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to\nshare certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance\nwith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on\neither a temporary or indefinite basis.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly referred to as Brexit.

The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or\nmaterial defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory\nproceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our\nbusiness, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or\nfines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose\nsignificant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including\nlimitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,\ntherefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\noperating results.\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus\non the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an\ninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit\nour future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\noperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses.

For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various\nlawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and\npayment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year.

Such\nviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory\nentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the\nsubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant\nto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we\nprotect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,\nfuture failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately\n$1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a\nsettlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September 2018,\nwe entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved\npayment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices.

We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April\n2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain\npersonal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security\nincidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and\nsignificant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal\ninformation of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. If Drizly\nbecomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data\nsecurity incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not\ncover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\nand security.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements.

If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n80", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4451, "end_char_idx": 6869, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4601617c-dc35-408a-9df9-cb8ca975f230": {"__data__": {"id_": "4601617c-dc35-408a-9df9-cb8ca975f230", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5af24c8b-419f-4738-ae13-91356481c0c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "b71c69db637f36a9a7eccc6b6af8895f59679255b6a7f9538b431fdd503db8be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "368c2701-c972-466d-8a3b-b9acd77e8d3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6942713420af2e68ac0c89dc173d1111e313024517e14bc71d3ed8e730524a8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA\nand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties\nfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to\nadditional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of\ncorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or\nbusiness partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our\nacquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be\nfamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and\ncompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held\nresponsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the\nidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\nDrivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our\nplatform.\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific\nregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be\nlicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become\nsubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,\nwe settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In\nconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to\ndefend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative\npublicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these\npractices.\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business.

Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by\nus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and\nindustry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have\nrequirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who\nuse our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings\non our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability\ninsurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to\nhave been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result\nin liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid\nclaims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative\npublicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by\ngovernmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.\nAdditional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service\nproviders and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with\nus.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the\nsubject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings\n(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of\nmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering.

You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or\npart of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other operating and financial results;\n\u2022 announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on our platform;\n\u2022 variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the financial community;\n\u2022 changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;\n\u2022 actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or\ncapital commitments;\n\u2022 negative media coverage or publicity;\n\u2022 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, including our\ncompetitors;\n\u2022 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022 lawsuits threatened, filed, or decided against us;\n\u2022 developments in legislation or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies (including any competition\nauthorities blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate in one or more\nmarkets, or requiring us to divest our or any target company\u2019s assets or businesses in one or more markets);\n\u2022 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022 any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022 any safety incidents or public reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry;\n\u2022 statements, commentary, or opinions by public officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of any interim or final rulings by\njudicial or regulatory bodies; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, such as the\ncurrent COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their\nstock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class\naction litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and\nfederal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with our IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and\nseriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, and\nthere can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose\nsome or all of your investment.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\n84", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4615, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbefb6f4-5dc5-4bae-b2bd-8940cb5fccc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbefb6f4-5dc5-4bae-b2bd-8940cb5fccc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cab445d8-b70f-4b67-9498-af6b8acd3e33", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_march_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1260185, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "57284933c9d403e45293a13ef82642b1ecaf51b34fc4c54f9eb92b6022b052a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common\nstock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem\nadvantageous.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and\nchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size\nand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required\nfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth\nofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain\ninternal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to\nconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market\nprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC\nor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other\neffective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nITEM 2.
