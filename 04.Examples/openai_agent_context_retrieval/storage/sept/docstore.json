STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers (\u201cShipper(s)\u201d) with carriers (\u201cCarrier(s)\u201d) in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment,\ntransportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding interim financial reporting. The\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.\nCertain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted\npursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nresults for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the\nfinancial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed\nwith the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and\nvoting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where\napplicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, we considered the impacts of the coronavirus\npandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. On an ongoing\nbasis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of\ncredit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment\nof goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other\ncontingent liabilities.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2\ninstrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using\nmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted\nmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of\ncommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held\ncompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\ninvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30,\n2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Note Receivables MLU B.V.

The carrying value of our non-\nmarketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative) or for impairment.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\ncomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes.

We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $(101) million and $(395) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,\nand $58 million and $(97) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2021, the\nincome tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Didi and Zomato, and to a lesser extent, by the benefit of U.S.\nlosses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred\nChina and U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Didi, the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora and Zomato, and to a lesser extent,\nthe benefit from our U.S. losses and current tax on our foreign earnings. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the income tax expense was primarily\ndriven by the current tax on our foreign earnings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the income tax benefit was primarily driven by the deferred\nU.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Didi, offset by current tax on our foreign earnings. The primary differences between the effective\ntax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Didi, the valuation allowance on our\nU.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $247 million, none of which would impact the\neffective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign\ntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in\nwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For\nour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the\nfull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through September 30,\n2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nNote 10 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible\nsecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using\nthe equity method.\n26", "mimetype":

such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\nwell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\nshipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 \u2013\nRevenue.\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,\naccordingly, we do not report asset information by segment.

Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may\nchange.\nOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance\nAgreement (the \u201cLPTA\u201d) with James River Group companies (\u201cJames River\u201d) effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary\nreinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our\ncaptive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the amount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on\nthese policies when taken together with previous risk transfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River were\ntransferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred\nClaims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we\nrecognized a $103 million charge in our condensed consolidated statement of operations consisting of the difference between the Premium and the assumed\nliabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.\nNote 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and\nSeptember 30, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other current\nliabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent\ncontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair\ncompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)\nclaims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit\nproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018.

On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit\nremains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\nIn April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and\nRasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App\nin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal\nTribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the canton of\nGeneva are classified as employees of Uber B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH.\nFollowing this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Z\u00fcrich that states that Couriers shall be considered employees for social security\npurposes since the launch of Uber Eats.

Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that\nthey should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The\ntribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of\nthe App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at\nthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law\npurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement\nprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement\nof historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are\nnot already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place for claimants who\nhave not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\n30", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3557, "end_char_idx": 6045, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c796e19a-1b08-4010-a005-7db8261855be": {"__data__": {"id_": "c796e19a-1b08-4010-a005-7db8261855be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59f5fe81-b571-47c0-8043-d033eea4f11d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "29921cbbc2ca9a05527f0b0bad2e51191cfc33e6f207bdb789e4eddbc8767405", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "558eeb62-d950-4ec1-9e21-55404aa78a24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28262e39d4fc680704b448553971528574b17616b52e14b409adf7074e3cf98b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.

We do not expect any\nsignificant impact to our statement of operations as we have adequate reserves recorded as of September 30, 2022, related to this resolution.

As part of our ongoing discussions with HMRC we\nanticipate that they will review our VAT remittance as a merchant of transportation. We believe that our VAT remittance is appropriate, however there is uncertainty\nin the HMRC's review and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\nOther Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe have been and continue to be subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices,\ncompliance with antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws,\nconsumer protection laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We have investigated and continue to investigate many\nof these matters and we are implementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our\noverall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations on our business which\ncould be time consuming, costly to investigate and require significant management attention. Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could\nnegatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational\nactivities and procedures.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions,\nwe may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with their activities or non-compliance with certain\nrepresentations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former\nemployees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations.

As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 million\nrestricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4 million stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. These\nreplacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition service were included in our option activity and were recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain\nor loss in our condensed consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the\npreviously recognized non-controlling interest was derecognized.

We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight\nindustry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies\nthat provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument has yet to be\nscheduled in that matter.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y.

We have concluded that we are an agent in these\narrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user.

Amortization includes expenses associated with our\ncapitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate depreciation and amortization expenses to increase as we continue to build out\nour network infrastructure and building locations.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:\n\u2022 Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.\n\u2022 Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.\n\u2022 Gain on business divestitures.\n\u2022 Unrealized loss on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and\nnon-marketable securities.\n\u2022 Impairment of equity method investment.\n\u2022 Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex (\u201cMLU B.V. Call Option\u201d).\n\u2022 Other, net.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax\nrates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will\nvary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and\nchanges in tax laws.\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n39", "mimetype":

The increase in\nGross Bookings was primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and a $1.3 billion increase in\nFreight Gross Bookings resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2022, we saw a\n$1.1 billion increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK. We also saw a $164 million increase in Delivery revenue resulting from\nan increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for certain markets where\nwe are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with the Same Period in 2021\nRevenue increased $11.6 billion, or 99%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 31%, or 36% on a constant currency basis. The increase in\nGross Bookings was primarily driven by increases in Mobility Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and a $4.4 billion increase in\nFreight Gross Bookings resulting primarily from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2022, we\nsaw a $2.2 billion net increase in Mobility revenue as a result of business model changes in the UK and an accrual made for the resolution of historical claims in\nthe UK relating to the classification of drivers.

We use MAPCs to\nassess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX\nShare ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a\nuseful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\nGross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility and New Mobility rides;\nDelivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives; and Freight revenue.\nGross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers.

In addition to revenue, net income\n(loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow,\nwhich are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our\nperformance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical\nperformance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key\nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\nthem analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies.

The preparation of these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and\nrelated disclosures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $239 million\nas of September 30, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. We\ndid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of September 30, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market\nfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.\nChanges in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4855, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24405577-4105-4123-bf30-a30779efa09f": {"__data__": {"id_": "24405577-4105-4123-bf30-a30779efa09f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f72ed63b-265d-4ca4-bfbd-3096f04776ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "5ddf2bb7d446cbae06d08377b7248037bc6541090558050f2da9cc97eeb04da0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2bde88a-f2aa-4340-909b-8373a502d1da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "8497624d0ce7fc4bcf2f46badd5b3e4cbab925c352e3bda94e6a357760304800", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We\ndid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of September 30, 2022.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule\n13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are\nreviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were\nno changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny\nthese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related\nto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where\nwe may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in\nwhich we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government\ninvestigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and\ninterim rulings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following\nrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\nbelieve are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u2022Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\n\u2022The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,\nlow barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\n\u2022To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,\nand may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n55", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5149, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1885a40c-3a75-45dc-aab7-69018905510d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1885a40c-3a75-45dc-aab7-69018905510d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "485df87b-4edf-40ac-938a-fdb0344ef7b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "b35723fbee6f5db5fa62f6d3c3ac9ee68975b1e295fd7d7686649ad0eb48406e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\nfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n\u2022Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects.

We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\nsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $477 million as of September 30, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal\nproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively\nimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be\nfiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4906, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2429d5ec-227c-4344-ac6c-3747b4b053fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "2429d5ec-227c-4344-ac6c-3747b4b053fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5e502bc-bb12-4747-94d8-fcf42653677d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "ec115ed364337c019f3e12efd7dd6a4d5c0df33f6f38b335ae4fd667ed93eef9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c11b063-de6f-4a76-b228-6cc7cd6a060f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "c86dab5d87ff7c8ad2e7dbd5123e4a390770a0c46232fcd36e4db7afc1f4df3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional\ncosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected.\nAdditionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we\nmay not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform.

Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather\nthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, going\nforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid\nholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a\ndriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French\nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),\ndecisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent\nSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are\nemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these\nindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are\nhighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and\nCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers\nto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to\nshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other\nmerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of\norders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a\nlimited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than\nwe do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.

These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase\nrevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to\nadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate.

In\naddition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable\nmanner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or\nmaintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality\nsupport, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our\nbusiness would suffer.\nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their\nservices through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or\nservices, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other\naspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar\nwork, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to\nimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be\nviewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security\nbreaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and\nmerchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our\nautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted\nin protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may\nresult, in interruptions to our business.

Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it\ndifficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny,\nand results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain\nmarkets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nWe recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed\nto have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain\ncontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,\nand consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we\nannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,\nmerchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the\nlaw, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result\nin harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\nmedia strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive.

We expect the total number of our employees located outside the\nUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,\nincluding engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new\nhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our\nexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.

In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates of violent crime, which has\nimpacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers being\nvictimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform.

On a smaller scale, we may face\nlitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,\nneed to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of\nwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are\nexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our\noperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant\ncosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently\nrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new\ntechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several\ncountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,\nwhich operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary\nUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight\u2019s business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest\nsignificant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our\ndevelopment budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.\nOur new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have\nlimited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including,\nbut not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate.\nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives\nwill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments.

Our growth strategy\nhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our\ncompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of\nDidi, and therefore we do not participate in its day-to-day management or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi. We are not represented on the\nmanagement teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and\nAurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions\nor take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their\nofferings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could\nenhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by\nsuch expansion into markets in which we operate.\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these\nassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect\nsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies\nhave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited\npublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular\neconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are\ndomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts\nof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on\nthe relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive\npositions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint\nventure, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broader\nconsequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions\nbetween the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted.

We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends\nmay develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality,\nour operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which\nwe operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth,\nour ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm\nto our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating\nresults. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant\nportion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in\nlosses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of\nthe value of their investment.\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results\nand future prospects.\nOur Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they\nwill continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nour ability to:\n\u2022 grow supply and demand on our platform;\n\u2022 increase existing platform users\u2019 activity on our platform;\n\u2022 continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\n\u2022 provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;\n\u2022 expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\n\u2022 compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\n\u2022 develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\n\u2022 identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\n\u2022 penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\n\u2022 reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public\ntransportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\n\u2022 maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\n\u2022 enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,\nJapan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n\u2022 increase positive perception of our brand.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming\nfrom continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier\ndemand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in\nvarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not\nachieve profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\nmetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo\nin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives\nand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas.

Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding\nepidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased\ncompetition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much\ngreater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas\nthat affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to\nrenew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such\nmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,\nthe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural\nareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would\nbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from\nairports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility\nand reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that\nridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations\naltogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such\nactions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers.\nAdditional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In\naddition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the\nnumber of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into\nagreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot\nguarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports\nin all jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform.

These\nregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,\nwe may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all.

Challenges related to our historical culture and\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\nOur employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,\nwhich includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges\nmaintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or\nlimiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19\nmore generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and\nsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicity\ncould lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior\nmanagement or other employee turnover.

We have\nentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.

Our servers and platform may be\nvulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures\nmay misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise\ndamage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,\nincluding potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.\nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental\ninvestigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in September 2022, we experienced a\ncybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed several internal systems; the investigation regarding this incident is ongoing. As an earlier example, in May 2014,\nwe experienced a data security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written\ninto code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October and\nNovember of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d). The accessed\ndata included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers\u2019 license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For\nfurther information on this incident, see the risk factors titled \u201c\u2014We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information\nfrom the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,\nlegislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,\u201d below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume\nliabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory\nauthorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January\n14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident\nthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed\nthat it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly\nobtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. Moreover, in October 2022, the FTC announced a proposed order relating to the\ndata security incident. The proposed order will be available for public comment, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed order final.

For\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new\nor upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in\nCalifornia have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and\nadverse impacts on the operation of our platform.

If the internal systems and tools we use to\ntrack these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these\nnumbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in\nmeasuring how our products are used across large populations globally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though\nwe prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior.

This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in\nwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many\njurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply\nwith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those\njurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for\nDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety\nincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of\nthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips.

Under certain circumstances specified in the\npayment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such\nactivities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self- assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate\nany deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In\naddition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could\nadopt new operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition\nto violations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive\nincentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons,\nor the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and\noperating results.\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our\nreputation, business, and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and\nmobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information\ntechnology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,\nincluding sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,\nviruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may\noccur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be\nsufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network,\napplications, identity management solutions or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise\nconfidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets,\nrequire us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase\nin hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,\nissues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or\nbreaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain\naccess to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective\nmanner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the\ntypes and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to\ndevelop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and\nsecurity breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security.

In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) (including machine learning) in\nour offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information.\nInappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations.\nThese deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to\ncompetitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\nimpacted.\nWe face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) and lower carbon\nbusiness models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters.

Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of\nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers\nmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted\nin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we\nexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net\nzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets\nenvironmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted.

In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do\nnot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,\nand results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business and financial results\nwill depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants\nof the virus, both globally and within the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on\ncapital and financial markets, the impact on global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and\nwhether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic or any future outbreak of a disease will have on our business partners and third-party\nvendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price\nand our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of\nheightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not\ncurrently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary\nperiods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point\nproducts over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or\nmay reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend\nto be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses.

Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or\nreputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar laws outside the United\nStates. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective,\nand such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will be\naccretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions we\nannounce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and our\nbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our\nbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has\nbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such\njurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\nexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.

Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.\nAdditionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such\nsurcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip\ntaken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went\ninto effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage\nrequirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being\nconsidered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely\naffected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that\nwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used\nthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision\nas a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars.\nFurthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could\nadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that\nhave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle\ncertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge\npricing with respect to our Mobility offering.

For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our\n81", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4005, "end_char_idx": 6843, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54b23856-e85d-49d8-955d-d3ef918ee4de": {"__data__": {"id_": "54b23856-e85d-49d8-955d-d3ef918ee4de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "deaf76aa-0805-41bc-83de-3f6c96b4a030", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "2177f29221ce647aebb17880fef189cb6e375dc34dc90f42d7e8ee488596eb35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3b226d9-8c69-4827-85c8-e76bdfbd5a5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e837e52708310028c3d850f39644e6ee6978519b6196f9c6dad259323780bd9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "platform. We are actively challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business,\nespecially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or\ngovernmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and\nimprove air quality in the city (including the institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an\n\u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect in April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and\nplan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle\nmiles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations\nin Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to\nprovide. Our failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us\nor shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK\nrepresented approximately 8.1% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform\nusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related\nto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product\nliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court\nof Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of\nAustralia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.\nThese legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which\ncould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,\nrevenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4667, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3b226d9-8c69-4827-85c8-e76bdfbd5a5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3b226d9-8c69-4827-85c8-e76bdfbd5a5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "deaf76aa-0805-41bc-83de-3f6c96b4a030", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "2177f29221ce647aebb17880fef189cb6e375dc34dc90f42d7e8ee488596eb35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "54b23856-e85d-49d8-955d-d3ef918ee4de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "5b9a7df58467d0605c4bc90b9eb46b78b278888f69ac6c67c787d92986bbacb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters.

An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our\nbusiness, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or\nfines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose\nsignificant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including\nlimitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.

Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\noperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are\nrequired to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may\nblock payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and\ninvolve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\nStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate\neach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received\nby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined\nwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments\nregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business.

Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including but not limited to, our business practices, such as\nfees, pricing, and related disclosures, relationships with third parties, and data privacy and security incidents. For example, in September 2018, after investigations\nand various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated\njudgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered\ninto a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC\nCommissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million\nrelated to the 2016 Breach. In addition, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of\nthe 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and it, as well as other security incidents we experience, may continue to lead to, costly and time-consuming\nregulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international\nregulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued a proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain\ninformation, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15 million\n($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021.

For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident\nthat allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of\nthis or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand,\nbusiness disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed\naccess to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class\naction litigation. Moreover, in October 2022, the FTC announced a proposed order relating to the data security incident. The proposed order will be available for\npublic comment, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed order final. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court\norders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face\nharm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not\nbe adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\nand security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received\nheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the\nadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5123, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "429e35dd-3317-4707-8274-a16882826b40": {"__data__": {"id_": "429e35dd-3317-4707-8274-a16882826b40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f31d4b13-b478-4d9d-8240-483451064a52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "e2096aad0164db759cee1e149eba3475dce742007b66ef90897165417b350e15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f63f02e8-7b71-404f-a8d3-178cada02c40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data\\10q\\uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2024-10-29", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-29"}, "hash": "f77b8340d10e31f49026db914fa45969a9f2ade34ed38056e49bd28ff716d8df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA.

Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time\nconsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal\nproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to\nchange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process\nfor all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become\nmore costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to\nour reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future\nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our\nlitigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings.

If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption.

Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition,\nit is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the\nmaximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new\nvehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth\nprospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,\nwe settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In\nconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to\ndefend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative\npublicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these\npractices.\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance\ncarriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects\nof our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our\nMobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist\ncoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a\nlimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot\nguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general\nliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner\nunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and\nCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant\nadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the\nrisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our\ninsurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by\nus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and\nindustry data.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the\nsubject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings\n(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters.

Often, their\nstock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class\naction litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and\nfederal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with our IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and\nseriously harm our business.

These provisions include the following:\n\u2022 our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or\nremoval of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;\n\u2022 limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired\ngovernance changes;\n\u2022 prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u2022 our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of\ndirectors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the\nprice that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
