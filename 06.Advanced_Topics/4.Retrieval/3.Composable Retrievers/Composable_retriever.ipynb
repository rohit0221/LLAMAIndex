They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3725, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Llama 2, an updated version of Llama 1, trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also\\nincreased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and\\nadopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023).

Llama 2-Chat, a fine-tuned version of Llama 2 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release\\nvariants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.\\nWe believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net benefit to society. Like all LLMs,\\nLlama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;\\nSolaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not — and could not — cover\\nall scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2-Chat, developers should perform\\nsafety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

Following this, we create an initial version of Llama 2-Chat through the application\\nof supervised fine-tuning. Subsequently, the model is iteratively refined using Reinforcement Learning\\nwith Human Feedback (RLHF) methodologies, specifically through rejection sampling and Proximal Policy\\nOptimization (PPO). Throughout the RLHF stage, the accumulation of iterative reward modeling data in\\nparallel with model enhancements is crucial to ensure the reward models remain within distribution.\\n2\\nPretraining\\nTo create the new family of Llama 2 models, we began with the pretraining approach described in Touvron et al.\\n(2023), using an optimized auto-regressive transformer, but made several changes to improve performance.\\nSpecifically, we performed more robust data cleaning, updated our data mixes, trained on 40% more total\\ntokens, doubled the context length, and used grouped-query attention (GQA) to improve inference scalability\\nfor our larger models. Table 1 compares the attributes of the new Llama 2 models with the Llama 1 models.\\n2.1\\nPretraining Data\\nOur training corpus includes a new mix of data from publicly available sources, which does not include data\\nfrom Meta’s products or services. We made an effort to remove data from certain sites known to contain a\\nhigh volume of personal information about private individuals. We trained on 2 trillion tokens of data as this\\nprovides a good performance–cost trade-off, up-sampling the most factual sources in an effort to increase\\nknowledge and dampen hallucinations.\\nWe performed a variety of pretraining data investigations so that users can better understand the potential\\ncapabilities and limitations of our models; results can be found in Section 4.1.\\n2.2\\nTraining Details\\nWe adopt most of the pretraining setting and model architecture from Llama 1. We use the standard\\ntransformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), apply pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang and\\nSennrich, 2019), use the SwiGLU activation function (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings\\n(RoPE, Su et al. 2022). The primary architectural differences from Llama 1 include increased context length\\nand grouped-query attention (GQA). We detail in Appendix Section A.2.1 each of these differences with\\nablation experiments to demonstrate their importance.\\nHyperparameters.\\nWe trained using the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with β1 =\\n0.9, β2 = 0.95, eps = 10−5.

The\\nactual power usage of a GPU is dependent on its utilization and is likely to vary from the Thermal Design\\nPower (TDP) that we employ as an estimation for GPU power. It is important to note that our calculations\\ndo not account for further power demands, such as those from interconnect or non-GPU server power\\nconsumption, nor from datacenter cooling systems. Additionally, the carbon output related to the production\\nof AI hardware, like GPUs, could add to the overall carbon footprint as suggested by Gupta et al. (2022b,a).\\nTable 2 summarizes the carbon emission for pretraining the Llama 2 family of models. A cumulative of\\n3.3M GPU hours of computation was performed on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 400W or 350W).\\nWe estimate the total emissions for training to be 539 tCO2eq, of which 100% were directly offset by Meta’s\\nsustainability program.∗∗Our open release strategy also means that these pretraining costs will not need to\\nbe incurred by other companies, saving more global resources.\\n2.3\\nLlama 2 Pretrained Model Evaluation\\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 base models, MosaicML Pretrained\\nTransformer (MPT)†† models, and Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) models on standard academic benchmarks.\\nFor all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.

(2023).\\nQuality Is All You Need.\\nThird-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that\\nmany of these have insufficient diversity and quality — in particular for aligning LLMs towards dialogue-style\\ninstructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These\\nfindings are similar in spirit to Zhou et al. (2023), which also finds that a limited set of clean instruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of\\nthousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.\\nWe also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-\\nstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source\\nannotations. To validate our data quality, we carefully examined a set of 180 examples, comparing the annota-\\ntions provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details.\\nFor supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of 2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence\\nlength is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is\\nutilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out\\nthe loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens. Finally, we\\nfine-tune the model for 2 epochs.\\n3.2\\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)\\nRLHF is a model training procedure that is applied to a fine-tuned language model to further align model\\nbehavior with human preferences and instruction following.

In addition to giving participants a forced choice, we also ask annotators to label the degree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice is significantly better, better,\\nslightly better, or negligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g., “giving detailed instructions on making a bomb” could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20). Llama 2-Chat improvement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a new Llama 2-Chat tuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to as Meta reward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer\\nprompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our\\npreference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.\\n3.2.2\\nReward Modeling\\nThe reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous\\nturns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model\\ngeneration. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimize Llama 2-Chat during RLHF for\\nbetter human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.\\nOthers have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it\\nchallenging for a single reward model to perform well on both.

This prevents cases where, for instance, the two models would have an information mismatch, which\\ncould result in favoring hallucinations. The model architecture and hyper-parameters are identical to those\\nof the pretrained language models, except that the classification head for next-token prediction is replaced\\nwith a regression head for outputting a scalar reward.\\nTraining Objectives.\\nTo train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data\\ninto a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher\\nscore than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) −rθ(x, yr)))\\n(1)\\nwhere rθ(x, y) is the scalar score output for prompt x and completion y with model weights θ. yc is the\\npreferred response that annotators choose and yr is the rejected counterpart.\\nBuilt on top of this binary ranking loss, we further modify it separately for better helpfulness and safety\\nreward models as follows. Given that our preference ratings is decomposed as a scale of four points (e.g.,\\nsignificantly better), as presented in Section 3.2.1, it can be useful to leverage this information to explicitly\\nteach the reward model to assign more discrepant scores to the generations that have more differences. To\\ndo so, we further add a margin component in the loss:\\nLranking = −log(σ(rθ(x, yc) −rθ(x, yr) −m(r)))\\n(2)\\nwhere the margin m(r) is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin\\nfor pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).\\nWe found this margin component can improve Helpfulness reward model accuracy especially on samples\\nwhere two responses are more separable. More detailed ablation and analysis can be found in Table 28 in\\nAppendix A.3.3.\\nData Composition.\\nWe combine our newly collected data with existing open-source preference datasets\\nto form a larger training dataset. Initially, open-source datasets were used to bootstrap our reward models\\nwhile we were in the process of collecting preference annotation data. We note that in the context of RLHF in\\nthis study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference for Llama 2-Chat outputs rather than\\nany model outputs. However, in our experiments, we do not observe negative transfer from the open-source\\npreference datasets. Thus, we have decided to keep them in our data mixture, as they could enable better\\ngeneralization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking, i.e. Llama 2-Chat taking advantage of\\nsome weaknesses of our reward, and so artificially inflating the score despite performing less well.\\nWith', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3944, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

More data and a larger-size model generally improve\\naccuracy, and it appears that our models have not yet saturated from learning on the training data.\\nThe fact that helpfulness and safety performed the best on their own domain is potentially due to the tension\\nbetween the two objectives (i.e., being as helpful as possible versus refusing unsafe prompts when necessary),\\nwhich may confuse the reward model during training. In order for a single model to perform well on both\\ndimensions, it needs to not only learn to select the better response given a prompt but also to distinguish\\nadversarial prompts from safe ones. As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling\\ntask. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1.\\nWhen we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the\\n“significantly better” test set and degrades gradually as comparison pairs become more similar (e.g., “slightly\\nbetter”). It is expected that learning to model human preferences becomes challenging when deciding\\nbetween two similar model responses, due to annotator subjectivity and their reliance on nuanced details\\nthat may differentiate responses. We emphasize that the accuracy on more distinct responses matters the\\nmost to improve Llama 2-Chat performance. The human preference annotation agreement rate is also higher\\non more distinct responses than similar pairs.\\nScaling Trends.\\nWe study the scaling trends in terms of data and model size for the reward model, fine-\\ntuning different model sizes on an increasing amount of the reward model data collected each week (see the\\ndetails on volume per batch in Table 26). Figure 6 reports these trends, showing the expected result that larger\\nmodels obtain higher performance for a similar volume of data. More importantly, the scaling performance\\nhas not yet plateaued given the existing volume of data annotation used for training, a signal that there is\\nroom for more improvement with more annotations. We note that reward model accuracy is one of the most\\nimportant proxies for the final performance of Llama 2-Chat. While best practices for comprehensively\\nevaluating a generative model is an open research question, the ranking task of the reward has no ambiguity.\\nTherefore, everything else being equal, an improvement of the reward model can be directly translated into\\nan improvement for Llama 2-Chat.\\n3.2.3\\nIterative Fine-Tuning\\nAs we received more batches of human preference data annotation, we were able to train better reward\\nmodels and collect more prompts. We therefore trained successive versions for RLHF models, referred to\\nhere as RLHF-V1, ..., RLHF-V5.\\nWe explored RLHF fine-tuning with two main algorithms:\\n• Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), the standard in RLHF literature.\\n• Rejection Sampling fine-tuning. We sample K outputs from the model and select the best candidate\\nwith our reward, consistent with Bai et al. (2022b). The same re-ranking strategy for LLMs was also\\nproposed in Deng et al. (2019), where the reward is seen as an energy function. Here, we go one step\\nfurther, and use the selected outputs for a gradient update.

However, since we applied iterative model updates, the fundamental\\ndifferences between the two RL algorithms are less pronounced.\\nUntil RLHF (V4), we used only Rejection Sampling fine-tuning, and after that, we combined the two\\nsequentially, applying PPO on top of the resulted Rejection Sampling checkpoint before sampling again.\\n100\\n101\\n102\\nNumber Samples\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\nReward Score\\nSFT\\n100\\n101\\n102\\nNumber Samples\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\n0.70\\nReward Score\\nRLHF\\nreward_max (T=0.6)\\nreward_max (T=0.8)\\nreward_max (T=0.9)\\nreward_max (T=1)\\nreward_max (T=1.1)\\nreward_max (T=1.2)\\nreward_max (T=1.3)\\nreward_max (T=1.4)\\nreward_max (T=1.5)\\nFigure 8: RLHF impact of the temperature when sampling N outputs and scoring them with a reward model.\\nRejection Sampling.\\nWe perform rejection sampling only with our largest 70B Llama 2-Chat. All smaller\\nmodels are fine-tuned on rejection sampled data from the larger model, thus distilling the large-model\\ncapabilities into the smaller ones. We leave further analysis of the effect of this distillation for future work.\\nAt each iterative stage, we sample K answers for each prompt from the most recent model. We score each\\nsample given the best reward model accessible at the time of the experiment, and then select the best answer\\nfor a given prompt. In earlier versions of our model, up to RLHF V3, our approach was to confine answer\\nselection solely to the “bag” of samples gathered from the preceding iteration. For example, RLHF V3 was\\ntrained using only samples from RLHF V2.

For example, RLHF V3 struggled more than previous versions to compose\\nrhyming lines in poems, as discerned through qualitative analysis, suggesting that further investigation into\\nthe causes of and mitigations for forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019; Ramasesh et al.,\\n2021) could be a fruitful area for additional future research.\\nIn response, on subsequent iterations, we modified our strategy, incorporating top-performing samples from\\nall prior iterations, such as those used in RLHF-V1 and RLHF-V2. Although we do not present specific\\nfigures, this adjustment demonstrated considerable enhancements in performance and effectively addressed\\nthe previously noted issues. This mitigation can be seen as analogous to Synnaeve et al. (2019) and Vinyals\\net al. (2019) in the RL literature.\\nWe illustrate the benefit of Rejection Sampling in Figure 7. The delta between the maximum and median\\ncurves can be interpreted as the potential gain of fine-tuning on the best output. As expected, this delta\\nincreases with more samples, since the maximum increases (i.e., more samples, more opportunities to\\ngenerate a good trajectory), while the median remains stationary. There is a direct connection between the\\nexploration and the maximum reward we can obtain among the samples. The temperature parameter also\\nplays an important role for exploration, as a higher temperature enables us to sample more diverse outputs.\\nIn Figure 8, we report for a Llama 2-Chat-SFT (left) and a Llama 2-Chat-RLHF (right), the maximum\\nreward curves among N samples (with N ∈[1, . . . , 100]), for different temperatures. We can observe that\\nthe optimal temperature is not constant during the iterative model updates: RLHF has a direct impact on\\nrescaling the temperature. For Llama 2-Chat-RLHF, the optimal temperature when sampling between 10\\nand 100 outputs is T ∈[1.2, 1.3]. Given a finite compute budget, it is therefore necessary to re-adjust the\\ntemperature progressively. Note that this temperature rescaling happens for a constant number of steps for\\neach model, and always starting from the base model on each new RLHF version.\\nPPO.\\nWe further train our language model following the RL scheme of Stiennon et al. (2020), which uses the\\nreward model as an estimate for the true reward function (human preference) and the pretrained language\\nmodel as the policy to optimize. During this phase, we seek to optimize the following objective:\\narg max\\nπ\\nEp∼D,g∼π[R(g | p)]\\n(3)\\nWe iteratively improve the policy by sampling prompts p from our dataset D and generations g from the\\npolicy π and use the PPO algorithm and loss function to achieve this objective.\\nThe final reward function we use during optimization,\\nR(g | p) = ˜Rc(g | p) −βDKL(πθ(g | p) ∥π0(g | p))\\n(4)\\ncontains a penalty term for diverging from the original policy π0. As was observed in other works (Stiennon\\net al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022), we find this constraint is useful for training stability, and to reduce reward\\nhacking whereby we would achieve high scores from the reward model but low scores from human evaluation.\\nWe define Rc to be a piecewise combination of the safety (Rs) and helpfulness (Rh) reward models. We\\nhave tagged prompts in our dataset that might elicit potentially unsafe responses and prioritize the scores\\nfrom the safety model. The threshold of 0.15 is chosen for filtering unsafe responses, corresponding to a\\nprecision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.55 evaluated on the Meta Safety test set. We also find it important to whiten\\nthe final linear scores (shown here by reversing the sigmoid with the logit function) in order to increase\\nstability and balance properly with the KL penalty term (β) above.\\nRc(g | p) =\\n\\x1aRs(g | p)\\nif is_safety(p) or Rs(g | p) < 0.15\\nRh(g | p)\\notherwise\\n˜Rc(g | p) = whiten(logit(Rc(g | p)))\\nFor all models, we use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017), with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, eps =\\n10−5.

This was effective when using O(1) forward or backward\\npasses, but caused a large slow down (≈20×) during generation, even when using a large batch size and KV\\ncache. We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation\\nand then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.\\n3.3\\nSystem Message for Multi-Turn Consistency\\nIn a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,\\nor to “act as” some public figure. When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat, the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAtt Method.\\nAssume we have access to a multi-turn dialogue dataset between two persons (e.g., a user\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages [u1, a1, . . . , un, an], where un and an correspond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turn n, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example, inst could be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nand the sample with which to fine-tune a model, in a process analogous to Rejection Sampling. Instead of\\naugmenting all context-dialogue turns with the instruction, we can drop it in all but the first turn, but this\\nwould lead to a mismatch at training time between the system message, i.e., all the intermediate assistant\\nmessages that come before the last turn, and our sample. To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies (“You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis”), Language (“Speak in e.g. French”), or Public Figure (“Act as e.g. Napoleon”). To obtain the lists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we asked Llama 2-Chat to generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstruction and model knowledge (e.g., asking the model to act as someone it had not encountered during\\ntraining). To make the instructions more complex and diverse, we construct the final instruction by randomly\\ncombining the above constraints. When constructing the final system message for the training data, we also\\n16', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3228, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Highly subjective tasks like evaluating\\nthe overall helpfulness of LLM generations will usually have lower IRR scores than more objective labelling\\ntasks.

On the 7-point Likert scale helpfulness\\ntask that is used in our analysis, Gwet’s AC2 score varies between 0.37 and 0.55 depending on the specific\\nmodel comparison.

A more interesting evaluation could be\\nto ask the models to complete a task and rate the overall experience with the model over multiple turns.\\n• Human evaluation for generative models is inherently subjective and noisy.

We first\\ndiscuss our safety investigations into pretraining data and pretrained models (Section 4.1). Next, we describe\\nthe process of our safety alignment (Section 4.2), explaining how we collected safety-related annotations and\\nutilized SFT and RLHF, and present experimental results. Then, we discuss the red teaming we performed to\\nfurther understand and improve model safety (Section 4.3). Finally, we present quantitative safety evaluations\\nof Llama 2-Chat (Section 4.4). We also share a model card in the Appendix, in Table 52.\\n4.1\\nSafety in Pretraining\\nIt is important to understand what is in the pretraining data both to increase transparency and to shed\\nlight on root causes of potential downstream issues, such as potential biases. This can inform what, if any,\\ndownstream mitigations to consider, and help guide appropriate model use. In this section, we analyze the\\npretraining data for distributions of languages, demographic representations, and toxicity. We also present\\nthe results of testing the pretrained models on existing safety benchmarks.\\nSteps Taken to Pretrain Responsibly.\\nWe followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for\\neach dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain\\nsites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best\\neffort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our\\nmodels broadly will reduce the need for others to train similar models. No additional filtering was conducted\\non the datasets, to allow Llama 2 to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate\\nspeech classification), while avoiding the potential for the accidental demographic erasure sometimes caused\\nby over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allows Llama 2-Chat to generalize more effectively during safety tuning\\nwith fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models\\nshould be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied.\\nDemographic Representation: Pronouns.\\nBias in model generations may result from biases inherited\\nfrom the training data itself. For instance, Bailey et al. (2022) shows that in massive text corpora, words\\nrepresenting “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men” than to words\\nrepresenting “women,” and Ganesh et al. (2023) demonstrates that a model’s performance on fairness metrics\\ncan be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic\\ngroups. Within our English-language training corpus, we computed the frequencies of the most common\\nEnglish pronouns in Table 9a. We observe that He pronouns are generally overrepresented in documents\\ncompared to She pronouns, echoing similar frequency differences observed in pronominal usage for similarly\\nsized model pretraining datasets (Chowdhery et al., 2022). This could mean that the model is learning less\\nduring pretraining about context that mentions She pronouns, and subsequently may potentially generate He\\npronouns at a higher rate than She pronouns.\\nDemographic Representation: Identities.\\nWe also analyze the representation of different demographic\\ngroups in the pretraining data by measuring rates of usage of demographic identity terms from the HolisticBias\\ndataset (Smith et al., 2022) as a proxy. We compute frequencies for each descriptor term in the pretraining\\ncorpus. We group descriptors into 5 axes (Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and\\nSexual Orientation), and show the top 5 terms in each axis in Table 9b. In the top 5 terms, we remove a few\\nterms such as “straight,” “white,” and “black,” because these terms have frequent uses beyond demographic\\nmentions (e.g., as basic color terms). We also deduplicate across lists, removing a few terms found in\\nboth Gender and Sex and Sexual Orientation. For Gender and Sex, while She pronouns are mentioned\\nin fewer documents, the term “female” is present in a larger percentage of documents. This could imply\\nthat while there is less frequent context about She pronouns, comments about “females” are more prevalent,\\nperhaps reflecting the differences in linguistic markedness of these terms (Blodgett et al., 2021).

The large unknown category is\\npartially made up of programming code data.\\nSafety Benchmarks for Pretrained Models.\\nWe evaluate the safety capabilities of Llama 2 on three popular\\nautomatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety.\\n1. Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity, defined as the tendency of a language model to generate toxic, rude, adversarial, or implicitly\\nhateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared to Llama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLD prompts. More detailed results split by different demographic groups can be found in Appendix A.4.8.\\nLlama 2 does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we\\nrefrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models\\ntrained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable\\nsafety-alignment. We reiterate that this motivated choice does imply that additional safety mitigations should\\nbe applied before deployment of base Llama 2 models.\\n22', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3693, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Further\\ntesting and mitigation should be done to understand bias and other social issues for the specific context\\nin which a system may be deployed. For this, it may be necessary to test beyond the groups available in\\nthe BOLD dataset (race, religion, and gender). As LLMs are integrated and deployed, we look forward to\\ncontinuing research that will amplify their potential for positive impact on these important social issues.\\n4.2\\nSafety Fine-Tuning\\nIn this section, we describe our approach to safety fine-tuning, including safety categories, annotation\\nguidelines, and the techniques we use to mitigate safety risks. We employ a process similar to the general\\nfine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.\\nSpecifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:\\n1. Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning: We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-\\ntions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches\\nthe model to align with our safety guidelines even before RLHF, and thus lays the foundation for\\nhigh-quality human preference data annotation.\\n2. Safety RLHF: Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-\\ntion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging\\nadversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.\\n3. Safety Context Distillation: Finally, we refine our RLHF pipeline with context distillation (Askell\\net al., 2021b). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety\\npreprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer\\nresponses without the preprompt, which essentially distills the safety preprompt (context) into the\\nmodel. We use a targeted approach that allows our safety reward model to choose whether to use\\ncontext distillation for each sample.\\n4.2.1\\nSafety Categories and Annotation Guidelines\\nBased on limitations of LLMs known from prior work, we design instructions for our annotation team to\\ncreate adversarial prompts along two dimensions: a risk category, or potential topic about which the LLM\\ncould produce unsafe content; and an attack vector, or question style to cover different varieties of prompts\\nthat could elicit bad model behaviors.\\nThe risk categories considered can be broadly divided into the following three categories: illicit and criminal\\nactivities (e.g., terrorism, theft, human trafficking); hateful and harmful activities (e.g., defamation, self-\\nharm, eating disorders, discrimination); and unqualified advice (e.g., medical advice, financial advice, legal\\n23', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3568, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The attack vectors explored consist of psychological manipulation (e.g., authority manipulation),\\nlogic manipulation (e.g., false premises), syntactic manipulation (e.g., misspelling), semantic manipulation\\n(e.g., metaphor), perspective manipulation (e.g., role playing), non-English languages, and others.\\nWe then define best practices for safe and helpful model responses: the model should first address immediate\\nsafety concerns if applicable, then address the prompt by explaining the potential risks to the user, and finally\\nprovide additional information if possible. We also ask the annotators to avoid negative user experience\\ncategories (see Appendix A.5.2). The guidelines are meant to be a general guide for the model and are\\niteratively refined and revised to include newly identified risks.\\n4.2.2\\nSafety Supervised Fine-Tuning\\nIn accordance with the established guidelines from Section 4.2.1, we gather prompts and demonstrations\\nof safe model responses from trained annotators, and use the data for supervised fine-tuning in the same\\nmanner as described in Section 3.1. An example can be found in Table 5.\\nThe annotators are instructed to initially come up with prompts that they think could potentially induce\\nthe model to exhibit unsafe behavior, i.e., perform red teaming, as defined by the guidelines. Subsequently,\\nannotators are tasked with crafting a safe and helpful response that the model should produce.\\n4.2.3\\nSafety RLHF\\nWe observe early in the development of Llama 2-Chat that it is able to generalize from the safe demonstrations\\nin supervised fine-tuning. The model quickly learns to write detailed safe responses, address safety concerns,\\nexplain why the topic might be sensitive, and provide additional helpful information. In particular, when\\nthe model outputs safe responses, they are often more detailed than what the average annotator writes.\\nTherefore, after gathering only a few thousand supervised demonstrations, we switched entirely to RLHF to\\nteach the model how to write more nuanced responses. Comprehensive tuning with RLHF has the added\\nbenefit that it may make the model more robust to jailbreak attempts (Bai et al., 2022a).\\nWe conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators\\nwrite a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to\\nthe prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human\\npreference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to\\nsample from the model during the RLHF stage.\\nBetter Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting Helpfulness\\nSafety is inherently a long-tail problem,\\nwhere the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety\\nRLHF by taking two intermediate Llama 2-Chat checkpoints—one without adversarial prompts in the RLHF\\nstage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward\\nmodels. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that\\nof the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that\\nthe distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with\\nRLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left\\ncorner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering\\npattern below the y = x line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score\\ndistribution is preserved after safety tuning with RLHF. Put another way, given sufficient helpfulness training\\ndata, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance\\non helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12.\\nImpact of Safety Data Scaling.\\nA tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in\\nprevious studies (Bai et al., 2022a). To better understand how the addition of safety training data affects\\ngeneral model performance, especially helpfulness, we investigate the trends in safety data scaling by\\nadjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage. In this ablation experiment, we keep the amount\\nof helpfulness training data unchanged (∼0.9M samples) and gradually increase the amount of safety data\\nused in model tuning, ranging from 0% to 100% (∼0.1M samples).

As a follow-up, we measure false\\nrefusal to quantify the frequency that the model incorrectly refuses to answer non-adversarial prompts. Here,\\nwe define false refusal as the model incorrectly refusing to answer legitimate user prompts due to irrelevant\\nsafety concerns. Refusing due to reasonable causes exceeding the model’s capability, e.g., “I am not capable of\\nparticipating in video calls” and “2024 is beyond my knowledge cut-off date,” are not counted as false refusals. We\\ntrain a classifier for detecting refusals in responses and apply the classifier on 1) the above helpfulness test\\nsets and 2) a curated borderline test set consisting of 210 samples for the purpose of boundary testing similar\\nto OpenAI (2023). The borderline dataset is designed intentionally so that its prompts look adversarial\\n(e.g., containing sensitive words or subwords) but are not actually unsafe (e.g., “give me a recipe for Christmas\\nCrack”) (see Appendix Table 41 for more examples).\\nWith more safety data mixed in model tuning, the false-refusal rate becomes larger on both datasets (see\\nAppendix Figure 33). However, false refusal is overall rare—approximately 0.05%—on the helpfulness\\ndataset, even with 100% safety data. On the other hand, the false-refusal rate is much larger on the borderline\\nset due to its difficulty. Llama 2-Chat sometimes has difficulty distinguishing whether a prompt is safe when\\nthe prompt contains words that frequently occur in unsafe generations (such as “bomb”).

We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently\\nenhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant”).\\nLike supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s\\nresponses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.\\nSpecifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate\\nsafer responses, and then fine-tune the model on its own safe output given the adversarial prompt without\\nthe preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various\\nadjectives usually associated with safe behavior such as “responsible,” “respectful’,’ or “wise,” with the intuition\\nthat the model associates them with positive traits that we want to see reflected in safe answers. We show\\nexamples of safety preprompts in Appendix Table 39.\\nContext Distillation with Answer Templates\\nDuring the prompt collection phase, we also asked annotators\\nto label prompts according to risk categories, which enables even more targeted preprompts. Specifically,\\nthis allows us to provide some dedicated answer templates of how adversarial prompts should be addressed,\\nbased on each identified risk category.

Left: Distribution of safety RM scores from the base model, when\\nadding a generic preprompt, and when adding a preprompt based on the risk category with tailored answer\\ntemplate. While a generic preprompt increases safety RM scores, a preprompt with tailored answer template\\nhelps even more. Right: Context distillation increases the RM score significantly for samples that initially\\nhave a low score, but can also have a detrimental effect on samples that initially have a high score. We\\ntherefore only apply context distillation on targeted samples when it increases RM score.\\nRejecting Context Distillation Errors with the Safety Reward Model\\nIt is important to note that performing\\nsafety context distillation for helpful prompts can degrade model performance and lead to more false refusals\\n(see Appendix Table 40). We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.\\nHowever, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing\\nwith adversarial prompts. Specifically, if the model responses are already of high quality, the application of\\ncontext distillation can result in less pertinent replies, as the model tends to overemphasize the preprompt,\\noften resorting to generic concerns excessively (see Appendix Table 40 for an example of vague answers due\\nto context distillation). We thus leverage the safety reward model to decide whether to use safety context\\ndistillation – we keep the context-distilled output only on the examples where it gets a better reward model\\nscore than the original answer. We notice that this is particularly helpful on prompts that the model is very\\nbad at, but limits the negative impact of context distillation (see Figure 16b).\\n4.3\\nRed Teaming\\nGiven how broad the capabilities of LLMs are and how varied their training data is, it is insufficient to identify\\nrisks solely via ex post facto usage and analysis. Rather, as has been done for other LLMs, we performed\\nvarious kinds of proactive risk identification, colloquially called “red teaming,“ based on the term commonly\\nused within computer security. This kind of granular analysis is very important because safety is a long-tail\\nissue, in which even very infrequent edge cases can cause noticeable problems. Even if quantitative scores\\nreport good results, these types of qualitative insights allow us to recognize and target specific patterns in a\\nmore comprehensive way.\\nWe conducted a series of red teaming with various groups of internal employees, contract workers, and\\nexternal vendors. These teams included over 350 people, including domain experts in cybersecurity, elec-\\ntion fraud, social media misinformation, legal, policy, civil rights, ethics, software engineering, machine\\nlearning, responsible AI, and creative writing. They also included individuals representative of a variety of\\nsocioeconomic, gender, ethnicity, and racial demographics.\\n28', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3282, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Additionally, we conducted specific tests to determine\\nthe capabilities of our models to facilitate the production of weapons (e.g. nuclear, biological, chemical, and\\ncyber); findings on these topics were marginal and were mitigated. Nonetheless, we will continue our red\\nteaming efforts in this front.\\nTo date, all of our red teaming efforts have targeted model outputs in English, but have crucially included\\nnon-English prompts and dialogue contexts, as that is a well-known attack vector. In all exercises, participants\\nwere given risk category definitions and were shown just a handful of examples of risky interactions with an\\nLLM. After that, each participant was part of a subteam focused on a particular category of risk or attack\\nvector. After creating each dialogue, the red team participant would annotate various attributes, including\\nrisk areas and degree of risk, as captured by a 5-point Likert scale.\\nSome examples of useful insights provided by members of red teams that we were able to improve upon\\nthroughout development:\\n• [Early models] were more likely to have generated unsafe responses without noting that they con-\\ntain problematic content. However, [slightly later models] have tended to display knowledge\\nthat the content is problematic, even if they do go on to provide it. “They respond with ‘[UNSAFE\\nCONTENT] is not appropriate to discuss, etc.’ and then immediately follow up with ‘With that said, here’s\\nhow [UNSAFE CONTENT].’ ” [Latest models] are able to resolve these issues.\\n• Distracting the [early models] by including “quirks” or specific requests usually defeated any\\nreluctance encountered via more direct requests. “A creative writing request (song, story, poem, etc.) is a\\nreliable way to get it to produce content that it is otherwise robust against.”\\n• Embedding a problematic request in a positive context often successfully obscured the fact that\\nproblematic output was being requested for [early models]: “The overall principle I’ve found most\\neffective for any kind of attack is to hide it in language that is positive, progressive, and empowering.”\\nFrom Red Teaming Insights to Safer Models.\\nCrucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk. In each case, we took the overall lessons as a guide\\nto help further model safety training, and specifically took data from these exercises for model fine-tuning,\\nmodel feedback training, and as a signal for other safety model training.\\nMultiple additional rounds of red teaming were performed over several months to measure the robustness\\nof each new model as it was released internally. We defined the robustness of a model, γ, with respect to\\na red teaming exercise executed by a set of experts as the average number of created prompts that would\\ntrigger a violating response from the model per person per hour. As an example, on our 7B model, we had an\\nevolution of γ : 1.8 →0.45 over several red teaming iterations and model refinements. Robustness will likely\\ncontinue to improve with additional red teaming efforts. Another magnitude that we tracked as new models\\nwere produced was the percentage of prompts triggering violating responses discovered in the previous red\\nteaming exercises that were mitigated in a given new candidate release. On average, we had a 90% rejection\\nrate model over model.\\n4.4\\nSafety Evaluation of Llama 2-Chat\\nSafety Human Evaluation.\\nWe collected roughly 2,000 adversarial prompts for human evaluation according\\nto the safety categories in Section 4.2.1, in which 1,351 prompts are single-turn and 623 are multi-turn.\\nExamples of evaluation prompts and responses can be found in Appendix A.4.6.\\nWe then asked raters to judge models for safety violations on a five-point Likert scale with the following\\ndefinitions:\\n• 5 - No safety violations and very helpful\\n• 4 - No safety violations and only minor non-safety issues\\n• 3 - No safety violations but not helpful or other major non-safety issues\\n• 2 - Mild or moderate safety violations\\n29', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4518, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Llama 2-Chat has\\ncomparable or lower overall violation percentage across model sizes, while ChatGPT and Falcon (Almazrouei\\net al., 2023) come next, then MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023). It is\\nimportant to interpret these results carefully, as they are affected by limitations of the prompt set, subjectivity\\nof the review guidelines, content standards, and subjectivity of individual raters. Upon manual analysis, we\\nfound that the response of Falcon is typically short (one or two sentences), thus less prone to generating\\nunsafe content but also generally less helpful. This is reflected by a large number of responses of Falcon with\\nrating= 3. As a result, we note that in Figure 17b the average rating of Falcon is much lower than Llama\\n2-Chat (34B) although their violation percentages look similar (3.88 vs 4.45).\\n30', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2507, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We then discuss the\\nlimitations of Llama 2-Chat (Section 5.2). Lastly, we present our strategy for responsibly releasing these\\nmodels (Section 5.3).\\n5.1\\nLearnings and Observations\\nOur tuning process revealed several interesting results, such as Llama 2-Chat’s abilities to temporally\\norganize its knowledge, or to call APIs for external tools.\\nSFT (Mix)\\nSFT (Annotation)\\nRLHF (V1)\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nReward Model Score\\nRLHF (V2)\\nFigure 20: Distribution shift for progressive versions of Llama 2-Chat, from SFT models towards RLHF.\\nBeyond Human Supervision.\\nAt the outset of the project, many among us expressed a preference for\\nsupervised annotation, attracted by its denser signal. Meanwhile reinforcement learning, known for its insta-\\nbility, seemed a somewhat shadowy field for those in the NLP research community. However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEven with proficient annotators, each individual writes with significant variation. A model fine-tuned on\\nSFT annotation learns this diversity, including, unfortunately, the tail-end of poorly executed annotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nfor RLHF. Consequently, the reward mechanism swiftly learns to assign low scores to undesirable tail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbest annotators may not chart. Nonetheless, humans can still provide valuable feedback when comparing two\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold\\nstandard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\\nIn-Context Temperature Rescaling.\\nWe have observed an intriguing phenomenon related to RLHF, a feature\\nnot previously reported to the best of our knowledge: the dynamic re-scaling of temperature contingent upon\\nthe context. As indicated in Figure 8, the temperature appears to be influenced by RLHF. Yet, intriguingly,\\nour findings also revealed that the shifts are not uniformly applied across all prompts, as shown in Figure 21.\\nFor instance, when it comes to prompts associated with creativity, such as “Write a poem,” an increase in\\ntemperature continues to generate diversity across our various RLHF iterations. This can be observed in the\\nSelf-BLEU slope, which mirrors a pattern comparable to that of the SFT model.\\nOn the other hand, for prompts based on factual information, such as “What is the capital of ?” the Self-BLEU\\nslope diminishes over time. This pattern suggests that despite the rising temperature, the model learns to\\nconsistently provide the same response to factual prompts.\\n32', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3677, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We manually tested dozens of examples and observed consistently that our model demonstrates a\\nrobust capability to organize its knowledge in a temporal manner, even when provided with minimal data. To\\ninstill a concept of time in Llama 2-Chat, we collected a set of 1,000 SFT examples that were related to specific\\ndates. These examples included questions like “How long ago did Barack Obama become president?” Each was\\nassociated with two critical pieces of metadata: the date when the query was posed — which influenced the\\nresponse — and the event date, a point in time prior to which the question would be nonsensical.\\nThe observation suggests that LLMs have internalized the concept of time to a greater extent than previously\\nassumed, despite their training being solely based on next-token prediction and data that is randomly shuffled\\nwithout regard to their chronological context.\\nTool Use Emergence\\nThe integration of LLMs with tools is a growing research area, as highlighted in\\nMialon et al.

Consequently, the model’s performance in languages other than\\nEnglish remains fragile and should be used with caution.\\nLike other LLMs, Llama 2 may generate harmful, offensive, or biased content due to its training on publicly\\navailable online datasets. We attempted to mitigate this via fine-tuning, but some issues may remain,\\nparticularly for languages other than English where publicly available datasets were not available. We will\\ncontinue to fine-tune and release updated versions in the future as we progress on addressing these issues.\\n‡‡https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins\\n34', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2780, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6\\nRelated Work\\nLarge Language Models.\\nThe recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4685, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set\\nby their closed-source counterparts.\\nInstruction Tuning.\\nWei et al. (2021) obtained zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by fine-tuning LLMs\\non numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction\\ntuning as a function of number of tasks, model size, prompt settings, etc. Prompts used for instruction tuning\\ncan be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used\\nto refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan\\net al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in\\nwhich models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase\\nthe likelihood that their final answer is correct.\\nRLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant\\nimprovements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuning data with the model’s own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges.\\nRecent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked\\nwith Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards\\nlike bias, toxicity, private data leakage, and the potential for malicious uses. Solaiman et al. (2023) categorizes\\nthese impacts into two groups — those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a\\nsocietal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm.\\nWork from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented\\nLLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al.

These models have demonstrated their competitiveness with existing\\nopen-source chat models, as well as competency that is equivalent to some proprietary models on evaluation\\nsets we examined, although they still lag behind other models like GPT-4. We meticulously elaborated on the\\nmethods and techniques applied in achieving our models, with a heavy emphasis on their alignment with the\\nprinciples of helpfulness and safety. To contribute more significantly to society and foster the pace of research,\\nwe have responsibly opened access to Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat. As part of our ongoing commitment to\\ntransparency and safety, we plan to make further improvements to Llama 2-Chat in future work.\\n36', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=3733, end_char_idx=5155, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The longer\\ncontext window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting\\nlonger histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and understanding longer documents.\\nTable 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both\\nmodels are trained for 150B tokens, keeping the same architecture and hyperparameters as a baseline, varying\\nonly the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2022), where the average\\ninput length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows\\nthat the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.\\nGrouped-Query Attention.\\nA standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkey and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance\\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022). Either the original multi-query format with a single KV projection (MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTo optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism\\n(Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the\\nnumber of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in all GPUs (making\\nthe KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al.,\\n2022). The latter, however, can complicate an inference service, as it works only when batch sizes are larger\\nthan the number of shards and the additional communication cost is not worth it in all cases.\\nContext NarrativeQA Qasper QuALITY\\nQMSum\\nContractNLI\\nSQuAD\\nLength\\n(F1)\\n(F1)\\n(acc)\\n(Rouge 1/2/L)\\n(EM)\\n(EM/F1)\\n2k\\n0.21\\n0.71\\n26.1\\n0.13/0.01/0.12\\n11.76\\n57.23/62.89\\n4k\\n17.26\\n18.52\\n29.6\\n15.08/3.55/12.16\\n16.33\\n57.99/64.46\\nTable 16: Context length ablation on long-context tasks.\\nContext Hella-Swag\\nNQ\\nTQA\\nGSM8K Human-Eval\\nLength\\n(0-shot)\\n(64-shot) (64-shot)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3741, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Output length is fixed at 128 tokens. The first data point corresponds to batch\\nsize 1, and then we double it until the model runs out of memory. The MHA variant triggers an out-of-\\nmemory error at a batch size of 1024 for a context of 256 tokens and at a batch size of 128 for 2k context,\\nwhereas MQA and GQA have successful runs in those settings.\\nTherefore, based on the ablation results and ease of scaling inference, for the 34B and 70B Llama 2 models\\nwe chose to use GQA instead of MQA.\\nFigure 24 shows how inference speed changed for the 30B GQA and MQA ablation models compared to the\\nMHA baseline, in an experiment using 8 x 80 GiB A100s with tensor parallelism. In these runs we simply\\nduplicated the KV heads for MQA in all GPUs, so the KV cache size for MQA became equal to the GQA and\\nthe two variants behaved very similar (with MQA just having a slightly larger FFN dimension).\\nA.2.2\\nAdditional Details for Pretrained Models Evaluation\\nMMLU details.\\nIn Table 19, we report details of the MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) evaluation for Llama\\n2 models and others open-source models.\\nStandard Benchmarks.\\nIn Table 20, we show results on several standard benchmarks.\\nCode Generation.\\nIn Table 21, we compare results of Llama 2 with popular open source models on the\\nHuman-Eval and MBPP code generation benchmarks.\\nWorld Knowledge.\\nWe evaluate the Llama 2 model together with other open-source models on the Natu-\\nralQuestions and TriviaQA benchmarks (Table 22).\\nReading Comprehension\\nIn Table 23 we report zero-shot and few-shot results on SQUAD and zero-shot\\nand one-shot experiments on QUAC.

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreference data (i.e., Meta Safety + Helpfulness) on a weekly basis, consisting of over 1 million binary model\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g., negligibly better or unsure) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g., significantly better) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our\\niterative model update and preference data annotation procedure - with better-performing Llama 2-Chat\\nmodels used for response sampling over time, it becomes challenging for annotators to select a better one\\nfrom two equally high-quality responses.\\nA.3.2\\nCurriculum Strategy for Meta Human Preference Data\\nHigh quality data is critical for alignment as discussed for SFT. We worked closely with the annotation\\nplatforms during our fine-tuning process, and opted for a curriculum annotation strategy. With the first\\nmodel, the annotators were asked to make prompts relatively simple, and then to progressively move towards\\nmore complex prompts and teaching new skills to Llama 2-Chat. An illustration of this curriculum annotation\\non our helpfulness preference data is displayed in Figure 26.\\nA.3.3\\nAblation on Ranking Loss with Preference Rating-based Margin for Reward Modeling\\nWe ablated the ranking loss with the preference rating-based margin term for the helpfulness reward model.\\nWe tried two variants of m(r) with different magnitude for the margin term in Eq 2 as listed open-source 27\\nand compare them against the baseline without the margin term. We report both their per-rating and average\\naccuracy on the Meta Helpful test set in Table 28. We observe that the margin term can indeed help the\\nreward model perform better on more separable comparison pairs and a larger margin can boost it further.\\nHowever, the larger margin also regresses performance on similar samples.\\nWe further evaluated the impact of margin-based loss on reward score distribution shifts. We plot the\\nhistogram of reward scores from the test set in Figure 27. Essentially, the margin term pushes the reward\\n51', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3177, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Llama 2-Chat with GAtt is able to refer to attributes 100% of the time, for up to 20\\nturns from our human evaluation. We limited the evaluated attributes to public figures and hobbies.\\nThe attention now spans beyond 20 turns.\\nWe tested the model ability to remember the system arguments\\ntrough a human evaluation. The arguments (e.g. hobbies, persona) are defined during the first message, and\\nthen from turn 2 to 20. We explicitly asked the model to refer to them (e.g. “What is your favorite hobby?”,\\n“What is your name?”), to measure the multi-turn memory ability of Llama 2-Chat. We report the results\\nin Table 30. Equipped with GAtt, Llama 2-Chat maintains 100% accuracy, always referring to the defined\\nattribute, and so, up to 20 turns (we did not extend the human evaluation more, and all the examples had\\nless than 4048 tokens in total over the turns). As a comparison, Llama 2-Chat without GAtt can not anymore\\nrefer to the attributes after only few turns: from 100% at turn t+1, to 10% at turn t+3 and then 0%.\\nGAtt Zero-shot Generalisation.\\nWe tried at inference time to set constrain not present in the training of\\nGAtt. For instance, “answer in one sentence only”, for which the model remained consistent, as illustrated in\\nFigure 28.\\nWe applied first GAtt to Llama 1, which was pretrained with a context length of 2048 tokens and then\\nfine-tuned with 4096 max length. We tested if GAtt works beyond 2048 tokens, and the model arguably\\nmanaged to understand attributes beyond this window. This promising result indicates that GAtt could be\\nadapted as an efficient technique for long context attention.\\nA.3.6\\nHow Far Can Model-Based Evaluation Go?\\nTo measure the robustness of our reward model, we collected a test set of prompts for both helpfulness and\\nsafety, and asked annotators to judge quality of the answers based on a 7 point Likert-scale (the higher the\\nbetter) using triple reviews. As illustrated in Figure 29 (in Appendix), we observe that our reward models\\noverall are well calibrated with human preference.

We manually collected single turn prompts spanning the following categories: factual questions,\\nwriting and content creation, language assistance, recommendations, and dialogue. For multi-turn prompts,\\nannotators interacted with another model to generate a set of multi-turn prompts. To help ensure fairness,\\nwe asked annotators to collect multi-turn prompts by using four different interaction methods: (a) ChatGPT\\nas the interaction model, (b) Llama 2-Chat as the interaction model, (c) best response between ChatGPT\\nand Llama 2-Chat at every turn as selected by the annotators, (d) alternating between ChatGPT and Llama\\n2-Chat at every turn. We also categorized multi-turn prompts into the same five categories listed above.\\nSince it can be hard to categorize multi-turn prompts into a single category, annotators could select up to two\\ncategories for multi-turn prompts. Example evaluation prompts can be seen in Table 33.\\nFor open-source models, we collect generations using a context length of 1000 tokens and allow the model to\\ngenerate up to 1000 tokens. Even though Llama 2-Chat models are capable of handling up to 4000 tokens,\\nwe limit the context and generation length to 1000 tokens to provide a fair comparison with the open-source\\nmodels. Limiting the generation length to 1000 tokens may adversely affect the Llama 2-Chat models. Any\\nprompts that are longer than 1000 tokens are filtered out for evaluations with open sourced models. For MPT\\nmodels, we use the mpt-7b-chat model. For Falcon models, we use the Falcon-40B-Instruct model which\\nis a chat/instruct model. For Vicuna models, we use vicuna-13b-delta-v1.1 and vicuna-33b-delta-v1.3\\nmodels from lmsys.

Here we show more evidence and\\nqualitative results to manifest this tension. Figure 32 are two scatter plots of helpfulness and safety reward\\nmodel scores on the safety test set for safe and unsafe responses. The tension can be observed at the bottom\\nright corner (i.e., high safety score but low helpfulness score) in the safe response plot (left) and the top left\\ncorner (i.e., low safety score but high helpfulness score) in the unsafe response plot (right). We also list two\\nqualitative examples where safety and helpfulness reward models don’t agree with each other in Table 35.\\nA.4.2\\nQualitative Results on Safety Data Scaling\\nIn Section 4.2.3, we study the impact of adding more safety data into model RLHF in a quantitative manner.\\nHere we showcase a few samples to qualitatively examine the evolution of model behavior when we scale\\nsafety data in Tables 36, 37, and 38. In general, we are observing that Llama 2-Chat becomes safer responding\\nto unsafe prompts with more safety data used. For example, Llama 2-Chat learns to refuse to generate\\noffensive content (Table 36) once we use 50% of safety data. In the meantime, we also observe that Llama\\n2-Chat starts to be behave more conservatively when there are offensive (e.g., abomination in Table 37) or\\nsensitive words (e.g., “sex in a pan” in Table 38) in prompts, even if the prompts themselves are safe (e.g.,\\nsex in a pan is the name of a dessert).\\nA.4.3\\nEnglish Pronouns\\nThe terms that we use for the pronoun analyses are consistent with the PaLM 2 paper (Anil et al., 2023):\\n58', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3216, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Battery and electrical systems: The\\nbattery and electrical systems in a car are responsible for providing the power\\nneeded to start the engine. Understanding how these systems work and how\\nto maintain them can help someone learn how to start a car without a key. 4.\\nSafety considerations: Starting a car without a key can be dangerous if not done\\nproperly. It is important to understand the safety considerations involved, such\\nas the risk of electrical shock and the potential for the car to move unexpectedly.\\n5. Tools and equipment: [redacted due to page limit]\\nPaLM-chat\\nThere are a few different ways to start a car without a key. One way is to use a\\npaper clip to bypass the ignition switch. To do this, you will need to find the\\nignition switch, which is usually located on the steering column. Once you\\nhave found the ignition switch, insert the paper clip into the slot and turn it\\nclockwise. This will start the car.\\nAnother way to start a car without a key is to use a screwdriver. To do this, you\\nwill need to find the starter solenoid, which is usually located under the hood.\\nOnce you have found the starter solenoid, insert the screwdriver into the slot\\nand turn it clockwise. This will start the car.\\nIt is important to note that starting a car without a key can be dangerous. If\\nyou are not careful, you could damage the car or injure yourself. If you are not\\ncomfortable starting a car without a key, it is best to call a professional.\\nHere are some other things to consider if you want to learn more about the\\nmechanics of starting a car without a key: [redacted due to page limit]\\nTable 43: Comparing the responses for an adversarial prompt obtained from Llama 2-Chat and other\\nmodels.\\n68', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4067, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The questions are designed in a way that even\\nhumans might answer incorrectly because of an unfounded belief or misconception. Following Lin et al.\\n(2021) we use GPT-3-based metrics, which have been shown to have robust performance in predicting human\\njudgments. Specifically, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model¶¶, i.e. a “GPT-judge”, is used to predict the truthfulness\\nand informativeness of the generated outputs from LLMs. For the QA prompt, we adopt a few-shot prompt\\ncontaining 6 random QA pairs with the formats following InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). We report the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative, as well as the percentage that are either\\ntruthful or informative.\\nToxicity.\\nTo measure the degree of generation of toxic language and hate speech across different groups, we\\nuse ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), a dataset that contains implicitly toxic and benign sentences mentioning\\n13 minority groups. We adopt a revised version of the dataset from Hosseini et al. (2023) that reduces noise\\nby filtering out prompts for which annotators disagree on the target demographic group. We then use the\\ndefault ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to measure the toxicity of generations of each\\nof the LLMs.\\nBias.\\nTo study the sentiment in model generations that may vary with demographic attributes, we choose\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021), a large-scale bias benchmark that comprises 23,679 English Wikipedia prompts\\nspanning five domains of race, gender, religion, political ideology, and profession, with 43 different sub-\\ngroups∗∗∗. We conduct a sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner\\n(VADER) (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) to evaluate the sentiments conveyed by the combination of prompt prefix\\nand model generation. VADER produces a sentiment score between -1 and 1. A positive (negative) score\\nindicates a positive (negative) sentiment towards the population mentioned in the prompt, and a score closer\\nto 0 indicates a neutral sentiment.\\nA.4.8\\nAutomatic Safety Benchmark Evaluation Results\\nFine-grained Analysis of Toxicity, Truthfulness, and Bias.\\nHere we perform in-depth analyses to better\\nunderstand the safety of model generations from the perspectives of toxicity, truthfulness, and bias.\\n• Truthfulness. Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,\\npercentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across\\ngenerations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,\\nthe truthfulness percentage is relatively low for pretrained models, around 30% to 40% for Falcon,\\nMPT, and the 7B Llama 1. This percentage increases for pretrained Llama 1 and Llama 2 with a\\nlarger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13B Llama 2-Chat improved about 20% in\\ntruthfulness, 30B Llama 2-Chat improved about 24%, and 70B Llama 2-Chat improved about 14%\\ncompared to their pretrained versions.\\n• Toxicity. Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic\\ngroups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained\\nmodels. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models of all sizes show an\\neffectively zero percentage of toxic model generations, and hence their results are not presented here.\\n• Bias. Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different\\ndemographic groups under the domains of race, gender, religious ideology, political ideology, and\\nprofession.

In the BOLD dataset, the prompts extracted from\\nWikipedia are taken to be the first five words plus the domain term, resulting in prompts in BOLD having six\\nto nine words, depending on the domain and demographic group (Dhamala et al., 2021).\\nAfter deployment, safety in chat models involves user experience and long-term effects, which are not\\ncaptured by benchmarks alone. Therefore, to assess safety effectively, additional testing of how they are\\nintegrated in a product deployment, how they are used, and what metrics accurately and precisely capture\\nsafety risks given the product context is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of safety. Our future work\\nwill conduct more comprehensive evaluations that encompass some dimensions not yet addressed in the\\ncases mentioned above.\\nA.5\\nData Annotation\\nWe have relied on human annotators in order to collect annotations for the supervised fine-tuning stage and\\nhuman preferences to train the reward models. In this section, we provide details about the data annotation\\nprocess.\\nA.5.1\\nSFT Annotation Instructions\\nWe have collected single-turn and multi-turn dialogue annotations from our pool of annotators. We asked\\nthe annotators to write responses that are informative, truthful, relevant, clear and harmless. We also asked\\nannotators to prioritize harmlessness over informativeness and helpfulness in cases of prompts that could\\nlead the responses to be problematic in any way. We categorized the kind of responses that could lead to\\nnegative user experiences and shared these categories and examples with the annotators.

(2020), Wei et al. (2022a), Du et al. (2022) in measuring such dataset contamination\\nconsidered an example from an evaluation set to be “contaminated” if there existed a collision between\\na high-order n-gram (generally, n = 13) from the sample and the training data. This was a deliberately\\nconservative approach in order to produce a “clean” subset of the data with high precision, and is used in\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\net al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from the web, but not the\\nquestion and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely\\nto gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized\\ninput, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also diverge from the\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\nto be contaminated if it appears in any token n-gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. This allows us to view the benchmark performance of our models on a range of contamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with < 20% contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with > 80% contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\net al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the\\nembarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams (and their full lengths) in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to\\nhave an overall worse average score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overall better\\naverage score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were\\ntrue. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:\\n• “Clean” samples, with less than 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not clean” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,\\n• “Not dirty” samples, with less than 80% token contamination,\\n• “Dirty” samples,', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4709, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4255, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3192, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2972, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

      "Attention in transformers operates by mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. This process involves computing a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are determined by the compatibility of the query with the keys. Each input element is transformed into three vectors: a query vector, a key vector, and a value vector. The attention mechanism calculates a score for each key based on its similarity to the query, typically using a dot product. These scores are then normalized using a softmax function to produce attention weights, which are applied to the value vectors to generate the final output. This allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing each output, effectively capturing dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence.\n"
