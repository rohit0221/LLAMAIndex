The people of India have reposed their faith in the government led by \\nthe Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and re -elected it for a historic \\nthird term under his leadership. We are grateful for their support, faith and \\ntrust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless \\nof religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their life goals and aspirations.  \\nGlobal Context  \\n2. The global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in \\nthe grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties and shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for \\ngrowth and upside risks to inflation.  \\n3. In this context, India’s economic growth  continues  to be the shining \\nexception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to be low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (non-\\nfood, non -fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure \\nsuppl ies of perishable goods reach market adequately.

As mentioned in the interim budget, we need to focus on 4 major \\ncastes, namely  ‘Garib’ (Poor), ‘Mahilayen’ (Women), ‘Yuva’ (Youth) and  \\n‘Annadata’ (Farmer). For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support \\nPrices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a \\n50 per cent margin over costs.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was \\nextended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.  \\n5. Administrative actio ns for approval and implementation of various \\nschemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required \\nallocations have been made.   \\nBudget Theme  \\n6. Turning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we \\nparticularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am happy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives \\nto facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth \\nover a 5 -year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore.  I will speak about \\nthem shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure.  This year, I have made a provision of ` 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and \\nskilling.     \\nBudget Priorities  \\n7. The people have given a unique opportunity to  our government to \\ntake the country on the path of strong development and all -round prosperity. \\nIn the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our \\npursuit of ‘ Viksit Bharat’. In line with the strategy set out in the interim \\nbudget, this budget envisages sustained efforts on the following 9 priorities \\nfor generating ample opportunities for all.   \\n1) Productivity and resilience in Agriculture  \\n2) Employment & Skilling  \\n3) Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice  \\n4) Manufacturing & Services  \\n5) Urban Development    \\n6) Energy Security  \\n7) Infrastructure  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Subsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and \\nactions.

This budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the \\ncurrent year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for \\ntransformative changes.  The  budget also covers some of the previously \\nmade announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their implementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.   \\nPriority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture  \\nTransfor ming agriculture research  \\n10.

For achieving self -sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, we will \\nstrengthen their production, storage and marketing.

Buoyed by the success of the pilot project, our government, in \\npartnership with the states, will facilitate the implementation of the Digital \\nPublic Infrastructure  (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their \\nlands in 3 years. During this year, digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI will be taken up in 400 districts.

These will be incentivized for \\ncompletion within the next 3 years through appro priate fiscal support.  \\nRural Land related actions  \\n99. Rural land related actions will include (1) assignment of Unique Land \\nParcel Identification Number (ULPIN) or Bhu -Aadhaar for all lands, (2) \\ndigitization of cadastral maps, (3) survey of map sub -divisions as per current \\nownership, (4) establishment of land registry, and (5) linking to the  farmers \\nregistry.

I start with GST. It has decreased tax incidence on the common man; \\nreduced compliance burden and logistics cost for trade and industry; and \\nenhanced revenues of the central and state governments. It is a success of \\nvast proportions. To multiply the benefi ts of GST, we will strive to further \\nsimplify and rationalise the tax structure and endeavour to expand it to the remaining sectors.  \\n116. My proposals for customs duties intend to support domestic \\nmanufacturing, deepen local value addition, promote export \\ncompe titiveness, and simplify taxation, while keeping the interest of the \\ngeneral public and consumers surmount.  \\n117. In Budget 2022- 23, we reduced the number of customs duty rates.  \\nI propose to undertake a comprehensive review of the rate structure over the next s ix months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of \\nduty inversion and reduction of disputes.  \\n118. I shall now take up sector specific customs duty proposals.  \\nMedicines and Medical Equipment  \\n119. To provide relief to cancer patients, I propose to fully exempt three \\nmore medicines from customs duties.  \\n120. I also propose changes in the BCD on x -ray tubes & flat panel \\ndetectors for use in medical x -ray machines under the Phased Manufacturing \\nProgramme, so as to synchronise them with domestic capacity addi tion.  \\nMobile Phone and Related Parts  \\n121. With a three -fold increase in domestic production and almost  \\n100- fold jump in exports of mobile phones over the last six years, the India n \\nmobile phone industry has matured. In the interest of consumers, I now propose to reduce the BCD on mobile phone, mobile PCBA and mobile \\ncharger to 15 per cent.  \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements are \\ncritic al for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defence, \\ntelecommunications, and high- tech electronics.

This  \\nwill provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and \\nhelp secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors.   \\nSolar  Energy  \\n123. Energy transition is critical in the fight against climate change. To \\nsupport energy transition, I propose to expand the  list of exempted capital \\ngoods for use in the manufacture of solar cells and panels in the country. \\nFurther, in view of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity of solar glass \\nand tinned copper interconnect, I propose not to extend the  exemption of \\ncustoms duties provided to them.  \\nMarine products  \\n124. India’s seafood exports in the last financial year touched an all- time \\nhigh of more than ₹ 60,000 crore. Frozen shrimp accounted for about  \\ntwo-thirds of these exports.

We will continue our efforts to simplify taxes, improve tax payer \\nservices, provide tax certainty and reduce litigation while enhancing revenues \\nfor funding the development and welfare schemes of the government.  \\n136. It has been our endeavour to simplify taxation. We have taken a \\nnumber of measures in the last few years i ncluding introduction of simplified \\ntax regimes without exemptions and deductions for corporate tax and personal income tax. This has been appreciated by tax payers. 58 per cent of \\ncorporate tax came from the simplified tax regime in financial year 2022 -23. \\nSimilarly, as per data available till now for the last fiscal, more than two -\\nthirds have availed the new personal income tax regime.  \\nComprehensive Review of the Income- tax Act, 1961  \\n137. I am now announcing a comprehensive review of the Income -tax Act, \\n1961. The purpose is to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and \\nunderstand. This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax \\ncertainty to the tax payers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in \\nlitigation. It is proposed to be completed in six months.  \\n138. A beginning is being made in the Finance Bill by simplifying the tax \\nregime for charities, TDS rate structure, provisions for reassessment and \\nsearch provisions and capital gains taxation.  \\nSimplification for Charities and  of TDS \\n139. The two tax exemption regimes for charities are proposed to be \\nmerged into one. The 5 per cent TDS rate on many payments is being merged into the 2 per cent TDS rate and the 20 per cent TDS ra te on repurchase  of \\nunits by mutual funds or UTI is being withdrawn. TDS rate on e -commerce \\noperators is proposed to be reduced from one to 0.1 per cent. Moreover, \\ncredit of TCS is proposed to be given in the TDS to be deducted on salary. \\nFurther, I propose to decriminalize delay for payment of TDS up to  the due \\ndate of filing statement for the same.

Even in search cases, a time limit of six years before the \\nyear of search, as against the existing time limit of ten years, is proposed.  This will reduce tax -uncertainty and disputes.  \\nSimplification and Rationalisation of Capital Gains  \\n141. Capital gains taxation is also proposed to be hugely simplified.  \\n142. Short term gains on certain financial assets shall henceforth attract a \\ntax rate of 20 per cent, while that on all other financial assets and all  \\nnon- financial assets shall continue to attract  the applicable tax rate.  \\n143. Long term gains on all financial and non -financial assets, on the other \\nhand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent. For the benefit of the lower and middle -income classes, I propose to increase the limit of exemption of capital \\ngains on certain financial assets to ₹ 1.25 lakh per year.  \\n144. Listed financial assets held for more than a year will be classified as \\nlong term, while unlisted financial assets and all non -financial assets will have \\nto be held for at least two years to be c lassified as long -term.  \\n145.

First, Security \\nTransactions Tax on futures and options of securities is proposed to be \\nincreased to 0.02 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. Second, for reasons \\nof equity, I propose to tax income received on buy back of shares in the \\nhands of the recipient.  \\nOthers  \\n158. To improve social security benefits, deduction of expenditure by \\nemployers towards NPS is proposed to be increased from 10 to 14 per cent of the employee’s salary. Similarly, deduction of this expenditure up to 14 per \\ncent of salary from the income of  employees in private sector, public sector \\nbanks and undertakings, opting for the new tax regime, is proposed to be \\nprovided.  \\n159.

Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to:  \\n• Withdrawa l of equalization levy of 2 per cent;  \\n• Expansion of tax benefits to certain funds and entities in IFSCs; and  \\n• immunity from penalty and prosecution to benamidar on full and true disclosure so as to improve conviction under the Benami \\nTransactions (Prohibitio n) Act, 1988.  \\nPersonal Income Tax  \\n161.
