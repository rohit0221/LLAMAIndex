    "# Recursive Retriever + Query Engine Demo\n",
    "In this demo, we walk through a use case of showcasing our \"RecursiveRetriever\" module over hierarchical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of recursive retrieval is that we not only explore the directly most relevant nodes, but also explore node relationships to additional retrievers/query engines and execute them. For instance, a node may represent a concise summary of a structured table, and link to a SQL/Pandas query engine over that structured table. Then if the node is retrieved, we want to also query the underlying query engine for the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be especially useful for documents with hierarchical relationships. In this example, we walk through a Wikipedia article about billionaires (in PDF form), which contains both text and a variety of embedded structured tables. We first create a Pandas query engine over each table, but also represent each table by an IndexNode (stores a link to the query engine); this Node is stored along with other Nodes in a vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "During query-time, if an IndexNode is fetched, then the underlying query engine/retriever will be queried."
